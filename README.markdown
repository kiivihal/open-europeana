# Open Europeana is dead, all hail *delving*#

Due to branding conflicts, we have been kindly requested to rename our open source version of the Europeana Framework. After long and hard thought we have come up with a new name: **delving**

You can find the new github repository here: https://github.com/kiivihal/delving

We like the name **delving**, because it has the type of connotations that we like to achieve. Bringing information objects together, mining them, and giving users innovative ways to interact with these objects. So the users should be able to use our software for delving objects, stories, etc.
