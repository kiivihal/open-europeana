<h1>Using Europeana</h1>

<h3>Welcome to Europeana.  Here is a brief introduction to some of the things that you can do while you are here:</h3>

<h2>Searching in Europeana </h2>

<p>Within Europeana you can search through millions of digital items provided by Europe's museums and galleries, archives, libraries and audio-visual organisations.</p>

<p>Searching in Europeana is simple.  Just ask yourself <strong>who</strong>, <strong>what</strong>, <strong>where</strong> or <strong>when</strong> you are interested in and type these words into Europeana's search box.  If you are stuck for ideas try:</p>

<ul class="point">

<li><strong>Who</strong>: Names of actors, authors, architects, artists, choreographers, composers, conductors, dancers, film directors, musicians or photographers.</li>
<li><strong>What</strong>: Words from titles of books, poems, newspapers, paintings, photographs, films or television programmes.</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong>: Names of towns, cities or countries within Europe or around the world.</li>
<li><strong>When</strong>: Dates (e.g. 1945) such as the year you were born in or a famous date in history or a period (e.g. Roman or Medieval).</li>

</ul>

<p>Using the <strong>advanced search</strong> you can search specifically for words in <strong>titles</strong>, for names of <strong>creators</strong> (e.g. authors, artists, musicians etc.) or <strong>dates</strong> (e.g. 1945).  Alternatively you can combine your search terms (e.g. <strong>title</strong>: hamlet and <strong>date</strong>: 1983).</p>
