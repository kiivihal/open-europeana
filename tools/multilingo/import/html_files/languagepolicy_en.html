<h1>Language policy</h1>

<p>
Europeana.eu follows similar policy guidelines to <a  href="http://europa.eu/languages/en/home" target="_blank">Europa</a> (the portal site of The European Union)
</p>

<p><strong><i>
As far as possible, the aim is to provide the public with the information they are looking for in their own language. However, due to constraints on resources, this isn't always possible
</i></strong></p>

<p>
Therefore the following guidelines apply in Europa and will apply in Europeana.eu:
</p>
<ul class="point">
<li>all top (*) level pages in all full partner languages</li>
<li>prioritise speed of publication over availability of translation</li>
<li>Allow limited "language mixing" (**) i.e.: where a warning sign needs to be displayed</li>
</ul>


<p>
(*) i.e.: the navigation, search, retrieval and display interfaces
</p>
<p>
(**) Language mixing = more than one language on a page
</p>

<p>
In practical terms this means the following:
</p>
<ol class="number">
<li>Tools to manage translation will be developed and maintained by Europeana.eu</li>
<li>The completion of the translations will be the responsibility of each designated volunteer partner institution</li>
<li>Europeana.eu will notify each designated volunteer partner institution should an update be required but will not chase for that update</li>
<li>Information that is urgent or has a very short life is in English only e.g.: Ad-hoc error messages</li>
<li>All surveys about the site will be produced in all feasible languages only</li>
<li>Search Engine Promotion to be executed in English, in the first instance</li>
<li>The Management section and the technical information will be maintained solely in English, as the working language of Europeana.eu</li>
<li>If, however, an individual institution wishes to translate and maintain any of the above from within their own resources, Europeana.eu would be happy to enable its display</li>
</ol>
