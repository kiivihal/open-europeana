<p>
Europeana.eu features and content have been designed to be universally accessible by users and user agents/devices. We strive to meet the WC3 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Version 1.0.
</p>
<p>
Our User Centred Design team frequently conducts usability testing of Europeana.eu navigation, flow, labels, and consistency. Furthermore, we will produce a version - post this prototype phase - for blind individuals.

Some of the accessibility features of our site include:
</p>
<ul  class="point">
<li>Meaningful page titles to help with orientation</li>
<li>Most all images have either a meaningful alt-text (text equivalent)</li>
<li>Minimal use of frames</li>
<li>Use of resizable fonts</li>
<li>Use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to separate content from presentation</li>
<li>Notifying a user when a link opens a new window</li>
