<h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>

<p><strong><i>
Disclaimer: Europeana.eu is a 'prototype', therefore the following term and conditions have yet to be subjected to a full legal study. They are to be seen as guide and an undertaking towards good practice.  A full review will take place during the course of the project Europeana v1, commencing in 2009, and the legally binding terms and conditions will be in situ for the operational site, scheduled for 2010.

<p>
Use of this site is subject to the following Terms and Conditions. This site is operated by The EDL Foundation, a foundation registered under Dutch law. The site is known as Europeana.eu
</p>

<h2>Copyright</h2>

<p>Europeana portal will offer:</p>
<ul  class="point">
<li>Editorial parts using material for which copyright issues and rights to reuse is cleared</li>
<li>Content: parts of bibliographic description and low resolution images given to us by the contributing EuropeanaNet Thematic Network partners to build the Europeana common access point to their own web site</li>
</ul>

<p>
The whole Europeana index and website is an online database owned by the European Digital Library Foundation.
</p>
<p>
For the purpose of this Europeana prototype (which is just a pilot demo) there is no formal agreement signed defining precisely where and how the rights are expressed in the metadata that Europeana are aggregated. Some metadata contain the expressed rights and in other cases the user is given more information on the provider�s own web site when clicking to see, read, listen to or watch the object. So Europeana for the purposes of this prototype will adopt the following Copyright statement from the MLA Discovery portal:
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right:60px;font-style:italic">
All third-party material presented within this website are subject to individual Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) conditions and licences. Providing details of such IPR and licensing is the responsibility of third-party sources and should be either presented within this website or available from the originating sources of the third party material
</p>

<p>
The lack of written agreement with each provider, other than the Thematic Network Agreement signed by each of the contributing partners, means that for this prototype a detailed Terms and Conditions of Use statement is not possible.
</p>
<p>
The European Digital Library Foundation and its content contributors hold the copyright for all material and all content in this site, including site layout, design, images, programs, text and other information (collectively, the "Content") held in Europeana.eu. No material may be resold or published elsewhere without the European Digital Library Foundations written consent, unless authorised by a licence with the European Digital Library Foundations or to the extent required by the applicable law.
