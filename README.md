# README for the Open Europeana Platform #

**Europeana** is an European Commission initiative to bring together digital objects from the four cultural heritage domains: Archives, Audio-Visual, Archives, Libraries and Museums. The Open Europeana Framework is an innovative multilingual high volume, high scalability search platform for Cultural Heritage metadata. The framework is developed using best-of-breed open-source software.

In order to promote collaboration and reuse of the software in the Cultural Heritage sector the software is developed in the open. You can download the source code at: [https://github.com/kiivihal/open-europeana/downloads](https://github.com/kiivihal/open-europeana/downloads)

Or using [git] version control

	git clone git://github.com:kiivihal/open-europeana.git	

or fork it on [github.com][open-europeana]

The easiest way to contribute code to [open-europeana] is to fork the repository and make a pull-request for your changes to be integrated into the main repository. Git makes it very easy to keep branches and forked repositories in sync or to cherry-pick some changes.  

The [github.com][github] repository is kept in sync with the [europeanalabs] subversion repository. This repository is used by the Europeana Core development team to maintain the operational service at [europeana.eu]. If you want you can also anonymously checkout this repository.

	svn checkout http://www.europeanalabs.eu/svn/europeana/trunk

However, other then the [github] repository it is not possible to directly contribute code to this repository. 

## Open-Europeana versus EuropeanaLabs ##

Open Europeana is the place where new functionality for [europeana.eu] is developed. When new functionality is deemed ready for production it can be integrated into the operational service code-base at [europeanalabs]. The Europeana Office decides the feature set of the EuropeanaLabs code-base.

The main differences between Open-Europeana and EuropeanaLabs are listed in the table below.
