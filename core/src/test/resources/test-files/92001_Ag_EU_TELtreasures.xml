		<dc:description>This is not the oldest printed book found in the National Library of Albania (the earliest dates from 1473), but it is the most important one concerning the historical-documentary value of the Albanian culture. At the center of the work stands the image of George from the Castriots' family (known by the Osmans as Scanderbegi). For a quarter of a century, at the head of the Albanian military alliance, he faced the Ottoman invaders preventing their irruption in Europe. This work points out the influence of the Albanian prince on the political life of Albanian people, of the Balkan Peninsula people and on the Continent.The author's name, an Albanian from Scodra, appears at the top of the preface: 'Marini Barleti Scodrensis de vita&amp; gestis Scanderbeg'. The publication data are taken from the colophon. The title-page is printed in red and black.The initials B.V. belong to the printer from Venice Bernardinus de Vitalibus, who in 1508-1510 was working in Rome; this suggests that the book was published around the years 1508-1510. It was republished in Latin three more times: in Strassbourg 1537, in Frankfurt-am-Main 1578 and in Zagreb 1743. It was also translated in many other languages, such as German, Italian, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, Polish, Russian, etc. Almost all these translations date from the 16th and 17th centuries. In Albanian it was translated in the 20th century (1964).Barlet's 'History of Scanderbeg' became known all over Europe. Based on his work many well known writers wrote on the life and deeds of the Albanian prince. Among them the Frenchman Jacques de Lavardin wrote 'Histoire de Georges Castriot Surnomé Scanderbeg, Roy d'Albanie', which was published in France six times: 1576, 1593, 1596, 1597, 1604, 1621 (in which year it was published twice in Paris by two different publishers). Next to the table of contents appears a portrait of Scanderbeg engraved on wood. On the first leaf there is a miniature portrait (5,3 x 5,4 cm) of the author Marinus Barletius. The title page is surrounded with an engraving on wood that contains also the bicephalous eagle, the emblem of the Castriots.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Hardly any other musical masterpiece has given rise to more romantic legends and speculative theories than Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Requiem KV 626. It was Mozart’s last work, which he was unable to finish, and is considered as one of the most important compositions in sacred music. The mysterious dark messenger who commissioned the work remained a mystery for some time. During the course of the 19. century it first became known that he was Count Franz Walsegg-Stuppach’s agent. The count placed an anonymous order for a requiem with Mozart because he intended to tell people it was his own work. After Mozart had died on 5 December 1791, leaving the requiem incomplete, his widow, Constanze, had to find someone to finish it, as Count Walsegg-Stuppach was becoming increasingly impatient. After several unsuccessful attempts by Joseph Eybler, Mozart’s pupil Franz Xaver Süßmayr took over, finished the orchestration and added the sections Sanctus, Benedictus and Agnus Dei. This is the reason why Mozart’s last work survives in two manuscript volumes.Only the first movement of the commissioned score (i.e. the volume which Constanze Mozart handed over to Count Walsegg-Stuppach according to the original agreement) is in Mozart’s hand, the rest is written by Süßmayr. The working score, however, which begins with the Dies irae contains all the surviving sections in Mozart’s hand. The imperial library (now the Austrian National Library) acquired the precious manuscript in various stages: in 1831 and 1833 the working score was acquired from Joseph Eybler and Maximilian Stadler and in 1838 the commissioned score from Katharina Adelpoller.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The large hand-drawn map of the world by Sancho Gutiérrez (1516-1580) is a copy of a formerly top secret and constantly updated document from the Casa de la Contradación (Spanish colonial administrative office). It was designed in the style of late medieval nautical charts (portulan charts), although the interior of the continents and isles are full of numerous toponyms and geographical details such as towns, rivers and mountains. The map also shows botanical, zoological and anthropological depictions as well as phantastic creatures. Textual inserts contain detailed information and source references such as reports of explorations and older geographical literature.The section on display shows the most interesting area of the map, a part of South America. Traditional knowledge from the Casa de la Contradación overlaps equal to more up to date information: the course of the Amazon and the South American west coast are drawn in two versions.This map of the world was drawn for the Emperor Charles V and well illustrates the comprehensive importance and role of old maps: firstly, the collection and reproduction in text and pictures of geographical facts and traditions - including mythological conceptions - , secondly, the map as a valuable document with which to demonstrate the claim for power and dominion.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Emperor Theodosius II called for the now famous Ecumenian Council of Ephesus (AD 431). The chief aim was the condemnation of the teaching of Nestorius, mainly thanks to Cyrillos, Patriarch of Alexandria. The council acts and the outcome were of such importance for the monophysitic Egyptian church that in the 8th century a luxury manuscript was made of the Coptic translation of the council acts. The double folio in the Papyrus Collection ( P. Vindob. K. 381) is the only surviving evidence. The section contains the names of thirty disciples of John, Patriarch of Antioch, who had opposed the condemnation of Nestorius. The parchment folio also hands down a very effective circular letter by Cyrillos against Johannes in order to win supporters for Nestorius, as the result shows. Today we too are witness of what happened at the council and are able to understand the council’s significance in church history – especially for the Coptic church. The council acts were written in Greek and must have been translated into Coptic immediately after the council had met.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The Wiener Heiltumsbuch belongs to the most well known works of the Viennese early printer Johannes Winterburger. He came from the Rhineland and can be traced in Vienna from 1492. His total production until his death in 1519 includes more than 200 printed works. As well as editions of classical authors, grammars for use at the university, scientific works, beautifully designed liturgical prints, official publications, broadsheets and popular works such as calendars, prognostica and the Wiener Heiltumsbuch.Heiltumsbücher are catalogues of relics which were on view. This kind of printed documentation was compiled for the pilgrims and is going back to the last third of the 15th century. The copy on display was commissioned by senator Matthäus Heuperger and contains a large number of illustrations; its 269 woodcuts and illuminated letters make it a unique example of Viennese woodcut-art at that time. As well as the illustration and commentary of more than 200 sacred relics, the book also contains a picture ofthe sanctuary stool (i.e. the exhibition building where sacred relics were put on public display) and one of the oldest views of St. Stephan’s Cathedral in Vienna. This woodcut takes up a whole page and is attributed to the master himself. The reproduction of the cathedral is remarkably exact, as shown by the details of the crane on the still incomplete north tower.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This eight volumed work explains the function and origin of the church building, liturgical robes, ceremonies and festivals. This work of reference is shown here in the form of a late medieval German translation from the Latin done by Viennese literary circles. The codex is richly ornamented with painted initials, initial-miniatures and margins including figures. It is a major key work in the history of Viennese 14th and early 15th century book art. The decoration of this monumental manuscript was interrupted several times. It must have taken about twenty years to complete and thus it documents notable changes in Viennese book art at the turn of the 14th – 15th centuries. The first page on display (the beginning of the first foreword) shows the decorative concept of the illumination with historiated initials and borders. The contents of this folio also document the possible occasion that inspired the creation of the codex: namely, the papal concession for the study of theology at Vienna University applied for by Duke Albrecht III (shown in several illustrations on this page). The historiated initial shows four deans honouring the duke: the medallions on the lower margin of the folio illustrate the receipt of the concession, the university and a group of students with their teacher.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The Brussels Coin Cabinet is supposed to possess the most valuable item in the entire field of numismatics whatever the period or the place of striking. This is the unique tetradrachm of Aetna which is often considered as the ultimate and impossible dream of any coin collector. This reputation, built at the end of the 19th c. AD, comes from both its historical and artistical interest. It gives a vivid illustration of what we know from ancient authors. In 476-475 BC, Hieron of Syracuse removed the inhabitants of Catana and Naxos from their homes, and replaced them by fresh citizens, drawn in equal proportions from Syracuse and Peloponnesus. The old inhabitants were removed to Leontini. Hieron renamed Catana Aetna, and gave it the old =Dorian= institutions. After his death (spring, 466) and the fall of Thrasybulus (spring, 465), it was not to be expected that the foundation would be left undisturbed; and indeed the Sicel leader Ducetius lost no time in attacking it. Assisted by the Syracusans, he was able to expel the Aetneans, who settled in Inessa, on the southern slope of Mount Aetna. This place in its turn took its name from the volcano, while Catana reverted to its old name.The unique tetradrachm, one of the most remarkable in the whole Sicilian series, is the most spectacular monument of the dozen years or so during which Catana bore the name of Aetna (small silver coins reading AITNAI do exist as well). On the tetradrachm, every detail of the types serves to give local colour. As B.V. Head wrote in 1883: >It can hardly be doubted that the Zeus here represented is the great god of Mount Aetna, the volcanic soil of which was especially favourable to the cultivation of the vine, whence perhaps the vine-staff on which te god rests his arm... It is noteworthy that across the throne of the god is spread the skin of a lion, or of some other mountain-bred beast of prey; but the most characteristic symbol on the reverse is undoubtedly the pine-tree with which, according to Diodorus, the slopes of Aetna were once richly clad... Seilenos, as we learn from Euripides satyric drama Kyklops, was enslaved by Polyhemos, and dwelt in the caves of Aetna with his savage master. More generally the head of Seilenos may be taken as pointing to the cultus of Dionysos, who, as we know from other coins, was especially revered at Catana; but, as if still further to specialise the locality, the artist has placed beneath the head of Seilenos one of those huge scarabei for which Mount Aetna was celebrated.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, entrusted Jean Wauquelin, a bourgeois from Mons and a bookseller in that town, with the French translation of a large compilation, written by Jacques de Guise of Valenciennes (+ 1399), entitled 'Annales historiae principum Hannoniae'. These Annales, originally written in the circle of the counts of Hainaut issued from the House of Bavaria, glorified the county's history in three volumes, from the fall of Troy to the death of Joan of Constantinople in 1244. On the 12th of April 1433, Jacqueline of Bavaria, Countess of Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland and Dame of Friesland, ceded these territories to Philip the Good. He found in the Chroniques the account of and the praise for his claims to the county. The payments for the execution of these three famous volumes are registered from 1448 to 1453. The duke kept a close eye on the work's progress.This manuscript was the first in the series of prestigious books that were commissioned by the duke and that are at the heart of the renowned Library of Burgundy. Several illuminators took part in the execution of the superb miniatures. Although art historians are still puzzled by a number of unsolved problems, they all agree that the illustrations of the second and third volumes should be attributed to Willem Vrelant and Loyset Liédet respectively. The miniaturists of the first volume remained anonymous, except for the school of the famous painter Rogier de le Pasture B Van der Weyden to which the presentation miniature, given its exceptional quality, can be attributed. Not only the contents but also the impressive dimensions of the three volumes contribute to the work's majesty and to its great appreciation by the duke and his successors. Having inherited the Library of Burgundy, the Royal Library of Belgium is now the guardian of the work and is responsible for its preservation in the best possible conditions.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>In 1770 Empress Maria Theresa decided to have a map drawn of the Austrian Low Countries. The surveys made by the general staff since 1749 were the basis for a detailed map of the country. The Earl Joseph de Ferraris (1726-1814), at the time director-general of ordnance in the Austrian Low Countries, was entrusted with the realization of the so-called "Carte de Cabinet des Pays-Bas autrichiens", one of the most important and most precious scientific documents of cartographic history in our regions.The surveys for the map lasted from 1771 to 1774. Although the Ministry of Defence was the original beneficiary of this enterprise, Ferraris also made a version for the general public. This Carte chorographique or commercial map was finished in 1777 and brought on the market in 1778. This version comprises fewer details than the manuscript Carte de Cabinet, whereas the Carte chorographique is engraved. Both the drawing of the manuscript map and the engraving of the commercial map were finished in 1777. Twelve volumes of historical, chronological and economic comments (Mémoires historiques, chronologiques et oeconomiques), accompany the Carte De Cabinet.The Carte de Cabinet is a coloured map. It contains 275 pages of approximately 90 x 140 cm. The map has a total surface of more than 300 m² and a scale of 1:11,250. The index to adjoining sheets has 15 pages and is in small format. Ferraris had three manuscript copies of the map made. Presently, these copies are preserved in the Royal Library of Belgium, in Vienna and in The Hague. The Carte chorographique des Pays-Bas autrichiens has a scale of 1:86,400. The engraver was L.A. Dupuis. It contains 25 pages, several of which are, strictly speaking, not part of the map.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>"The Rabbit Hunt", dated 1560, is Bruegel's first and only attempt at print making. Edited in Antwerp by Hieronymus Cock for whom he made numerous drawings of various subjects for engravings after his return from Italy in 1554. The composition is reminiscent of the series of twelve large landscapes etched by the brothers Duetecum (after 1555), not without sacrificing the delicacy of Bruegel's drawings. That is why it has been suggested that the artist's own experiment in the technique was an attempt to see if a more appropriate transition from drawing to print could be made.Bruegel used the etching needle as a drawing tool by making maximum use of the white of the paper and by shunning the contour in favor of short strokes and dots. Particularlyremarkable is the treatment of foliage and details of the distant landscape. It has been proposed that the hunter represents and Erasmus proverb: 'He who chases two hares will catch neither'. As an example of Bruegel's humour, the man with the spear behind the tree - marauding soldier- is about to turn the tables on the hunter.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The manuscript known as the 'Van Hulthem manuscript' is among the most precious treasures of the Royal Library of Belgium. It is also the masterpiece of medieval Dutch literature. Its content is extremely rich and varied, consisting of more than two hundred texts most of which can only be found in this book. The manuscript's content was once summarized in the following pithy expression: 'all of life's intensity in one volume'. In past times this extraordinary manuscript also used to be called 'the Night Watch of Middle Dutch literature'. Recently it received its most prestigious distinction, that of 'Cultural Ambassador of Flanders'.The manuscript is named after its last private owner, Charles Van Hulthem (1764-1832), who lived in Ghent. He was a passionate bibliophile. This manuscript probably was the outstanding showpiece of his collection. Through the diversity of its content it gives a fine idea of the kind of texts circulating in and around Brussels during the late Middle Ages. There are both spiritual and profane texts, as well as plays, epic and lyrical poetry. The most diverse genres and types are represented: fabliaux, fables, love songs, prayers, sayings, satires, religious texts, theatre, tales, excerpts from the works of famous writers... This is nothing more than a selection out of a very large offer. Some best-sellers are at the centre : The Voyage of Saint Brendan, The Viscour tess of Vergi and the famous 'abele spelen' (profane theatre, unique in the world), which we would not have known if it were not for this manuscript. These - somewhat longer - texts have always received a lot of attention from international literary historians.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Manuscript is rarity. Husein Bošnjak transcribed it in 1169/1755-56. Apart from its cultural and historical importance this manuscript has special artistic value. It was written in typical handwriting of 17th century and it was illuminated in nine colors. This manuscript was the basis for the facsimile edition, enriched with artistic painted details of Mersad Berber when in 1977 Oriental Institute in Sarajevo published it with Besim Korkut's translation into Bosnian language. However, even the most advanced technology can notmatch the extraordinary work of the original script and the bookbinding.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This is a first geographic map where Bosnia and Herzegovina is represented as a single country. Until 17th century Bosnia and Herzegovina was shown as a part of larger region. The map is distinguished achievement of Italian cartographer. On this map we can see the political-administrative division with all physical-geographical features. For the first time the names of mountains, fields, rivers and places can be recognized. Relief follows the realistic directions of mountains, fields, etc. However, some rivers are wrongly inscribed which is understandable for the time when the map was made.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The manuscript titled 'The Legends of the Prophets' is an example of a wide spread genre in the literature of the Muslim countries, mainly in the Persian language, named by tradition 'Qisas al-anbiyâ''. These are legends for the Biblical and Muslim prophets where Âdam has been the first and Mohammad and the Patriarchal caliphs are the last. Here are introduced the Old Testament persons as Abraham (Ibrâhîm), Joseph (Yûsuf), Moses (Mûsâ), Solomon (Sulaymân), David (Dâwûd) and the New Testament Mary (Maryam) and Jesus (Îsâ). This work is an illustration of the succession and the interrelations between differing religions as told in the Biblical legends. In the catalogues of Islamic manuscripts this title may be seen on various works concerning the same theme but there is no equivalent to the manuscript kept in the National Library in Sofia that makes it unique. The manuscript is designed magnificently. The binding and the ornamental decoration made with great skill, add to the literary value of the book. The 18 illustrations to the text, performed, probably, by artists of the Kazwinian School (Iran), are good examples of the miniature painting in the Persian manuscript book from the second half of the 16th century. The miniature depicts the Noah's Ark. The person with a halo is Noah. The figure at the edge is probably Noah's son whose skin had become darker because of his father's damnation.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The manuscript collection, substantial by itself as a code, includes the illustrated "Alexandria" of Sofia, the Legend for the Indian Kingdom, various liturgical articles, proverbs and texts devoted to fortune-telling and the Trojan Legend (a story about the Trojan war). The well-known life-story of the Macedonian king Alexander, the son of King Philip II the Macedonian, who lived in the 4th century B.C. is among the scarce works discussing subjects classified as secular Middle Age literature including the Southern Slavic literature. In the Middle Ages the "Alexandria" was wide spread in Western Europe in its Latin versions, one of them created in the 10th century served as basic for many adaptations in the French, German and Czech literatures. Two versions appeared in different times in the Slavic South: the first one being Bulgarian (10th-11th c.) and the second one being Serbian (from the end of the 13th century and the begining of the 14th century).The manuscript introduced here is one of the earliest Slavic transcriptions of this work abounding in illustrations. It contains the Serbian version of the story popular as the "Serbian Alexandria". As a typical work of the literature about fantastic heroes, with a rich and entertaining subject of narration, this story is well-known in the 14th and 15th centuries in the Slavic world. The interest in it continued until the 19th century encouraged by the printed issues of the work. The leaf with the miniature "Carrying the Body of Alexander to Alexandria" is one of the 14 saved illustrations in the collection that are connected only with the text of this Middle Age story.</dc:description>

The information about different countries is illustrated with 70 maps made by al-Idrîsî. That maps were the most valuable achievement both of the Arabic and the European cartography as it was at the begining of the classical period of the Middle Ages. Several copies made in various periods are saved until present days. The Sofia manuscript is the latest one among four altogether known to be complete (i.e. consisting of text and maps) copies: the Paris manuscript (Bibliotèque Nationale, AR 2221), the Oxford and the Istanbul copies (Köprülü kütüphanesi, 955).According to some notices made in the Sofia manuscript testifying to its collation with the autograph, it is supposed that the original had existed, already in the mid-16th century. Its later history is obscure. More than 400 years after the author's death, this exclusive work remained unknown in Europe. For the first time in 1592 a fragment of the geography had been published in the famous Medicea Typographyin Rome with the author never been pointed out. Not until 1796 the name of al-Idrîsî and 'Kitâb al-Rujâr' are mentioned in the European geographic literature. A map depicting the Northern coast of Marmara Sea, Galipoli Peninsula and a great part of the Aegean coast of the Peloponnesus Peninsula (including Khalkis Peninsula, Euboea Island and Idhra). Macedonia and parts of Central Greece and Thessaly are shown, too.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The Enina Apostle is a rare, and unique in its antiquity, cyrillic handwritten record belonging to the group of the ancient old-Bulgarian monuments from the 10th and 11th century. It is of essential importance for the universal Slavistics. The copy is a transcription of the earliest translation of this kind of liturgical literature and was made by the Slavic first-teachers St.Cyril and St.Methodius when the Slavic world converted to Christianity. According to its contents the book is a part of a liturgical apostle as the leaves which have been saved until the present day consist of apostolic readings from the 35th Sunday after Pentecost until the vespers of the Holy Saturday and from the 1st September until the 3rd October - the Day of Dionisos the Areopagite. The thirty nine oiled paper leaves provide a good opportunity for the original ancient Slavic cyrillic letters to be traced back and for a study of their relative ornamental glagolitic drawings used at various places in the text.The book is of great importance for the study of the basic linguistic, orthographic and textual characteristics of the oldest Bulgarian liturgical literature as a branch of the Christian culture in early orthodox Europe. These features are in common with the best known early glagolitic and cyrillic manuscripts such as Aprakos Evangelion (Codex Assemanianus), Codex Clozianus, Psalterum Sinaiticum, Lectionary Gospel (Savina kniga), etc. The leaf is one of the saved ornamented glagolitic initials B. The interlaced details prevail in the decoration of the initials. The bands in the interlacing are coloured red and ink-brown; in some places they are divided in chess-board order. Besides these some ornamental elements are used in the decoration that are supposed to have been invented on our native soil but which do not conform to the Byzantine examples.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The Ordinance by Vasil Levski, being a revolutionary code in its essence, is a great achievement of the democratic thought that constitutes not only the ideology of the Bulgarian liberation movement but the era of the liberating revolutions as a whole. Though it bears specific Bulgarian characteristics and circumstances, this document is unique by itself in the history of the liberating struggles in the XIX c. with its logistic and systematic construction, the consistent democracy not opposed to the opportunity for the people's revolutionary will to be imposed with good organization and violence, even. In the Ordinance Levski draws the outlines of the future free democratic society, of the "sacred and fair republic", of the "people's government" based on the Renaissance and the enlighted political thought.

		<dc:description>Martin Rota Kolunic (Martinus Rota) was born in c. 1540 inŠibenik, Croatia. About 1565 he was already working as an engraver in Venice, while by 1573 he became the court portraitist in Vienna. He died in Prague in 1583. He belongs to the most significant European graphic artists of the second half of the 16th century. He is also well known for his reproductions of the outstanding masters of the Renaissance: Tizian, Michelangelo, Dürer and others. He engraved a number of portraits of important persons of his time, and remarkable geographical maps and vedutes. He immortalized his home townŠibenik as well as his compatriot Antun Vrancic (Antonius Verantius) on his prints.The portrait of the emperor Ferdinand I (1503-1564) was probably made according to the medal which was created by J. Deschler in 1561. On the portrait of the emperor Ferdinand I, the master draws the forms with a clear and steady line, separating the body from its background. He uses a number of different types of "morphemes" for shading in order to create plasticity of forms, the strength of light and shadow, orthe density of the pictorial atmosphere. The background of the composition is drawn in long, parallel lines of equal density to which the whiteness in the lower part of the picture is contrasted. In all the places where shadow dominates, the nets of differing density and differing layers appear depending on the shadow's depth, composed of slanting or curved crossed lines, a texture of broken lines, their combinations and netting.

		<dc:description>The 1483 editio princeps is the first Croatian and one of the first South Slavonic printed books. It was written in the Croatian version of Church Slavonic language and printed in specific Croatian Glagolitic script. The famous codex 'Misal kneza Novaka', from 1368, (Prince Novak's Missal) is considered to be its principal model in terms of subject and equivalent Glagolitic letters. Detailed analytical and comparative study of the text with other well-known handwritten Glagolitic missals, proved that the first Croatian printed book was edited by the Croats from Istria.Nevertheless, the Croatian editio princeps does not reflect particular rituals of any church or diocese, but strictly follows the content of the Latin Editio princeps (Milan, 1474) with slight differences in the order of some rituals. While the date of printing is shown in the colophon, the place of printing of the 1483 editio princeps still remains to be positively identified. Some researchers consider that it was printed in Venice, but recent research assume suggests that it might have been printed in Kosinj in the Lika region. Only eleven incomplete copies and six fragments have been preserved worldwide; five copies are held in Zagreb. Among these are the two copies in the National and University Library, and in the library of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. The Franciscan monastery in Zagreb and the Dominican monastery on the island of Brac each have one copy.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This hand drawn maritime atlas and accompaning manuscript are the work of one of the greatest hydrographers and maritime explorers, a member of The French Academy of Science, Charles François Beautemps-Beaupré. The author is also called the father of hydrography due to his outstanding contributions to the scientific approach to hydrography. In the year 1806, C.F. Beautemps-Beaupré, was sent by Napoleon's orders to the Eastern coast of the Adriatic sea, in order to perform hydrographic surveys. The Atlas contains hand drawn maritime charts (harbour plans) of the Eastern coast of the Adriatic (Croatia). The maps are of various sizes, from 28 x 39 cm to 169 x 158 cm. 15 hand drawnmaps and 2 charts of coastal contours represent highest hydrographic, cartographic, drawing and caligraphic craftsmanship with the use of a wide spectrum of water colours. The scale of most of the maps is 1:7200. The charts, based on C. F. Beautemps-Beaupré's surveys, data and sketches were finished in the Military-Geographic Institute of Italy, under the supervision of the secretary of war Caffarelli. This unique Atlas is of outstanding artistic and scientific value, and is a contribution to the scientific, cultural and historical accounts of the Croatian coast.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This monumental collection of choral melodies and church tunes with Latin and Croatian (kajkavian) texts, divided into eight sections largely corresponding to the parts of the liturgical year, appeared in 1701 as a small-sized volume with square notes of equal value and without bar-lines. The notes are written on four lines. Cithara octochorda records the church musical repertory of the Northern Croatia, which had until that time been scattered in a number of (mostly manuscript) collections. The new collection was intended to be used for choral singing in the churches of the Zagreb diocese. The second edition in 1723 was particularly important: with its subtitle Cantus sacri latino-croatici, it was greatly enlarged and improved, and it actually served as a prototype for the third edition, which was published in Zagreb in 1757, and which is here represented. The presentation of the material in each of the eight sections is the same in all three editions: first come Latin texts with choral masses (except in Sections 3 and 5) and their tunes; then follow - usually in the same but sometimes also in new - tunes with Croatian (kajkavian) texts. Some of the tunes are close to the spirit of Croatian folk songs, but there are also tunes with the musical characteristics of songs belonging to other nations (Slovaks, Hungarians, etc.).Several characteristics make this songbook exceptional: systematicity in the arrangement of the musical material; critical screening of the material from earlier sources (both domestic liturgical books and foreign collections); exemplary technical presentation of the musical component of the songs; more than careful concern for the domestic (anonymous) church music based on Croatian folk music. Three editions of Cithara octochorda in some fifty years prove that the collection filled a genuine need and that it was well received by those for whom it was intended. It was close to the hearts of its users: it helped the clergy to conduct the liturgy in Latin, and it helped the people, in their local kajkavian dialect, to appreciate the beauty of many well-liked and folk-inspired tunes.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Istarski razvod is the legal document of the boundary commission in Istria formed to establish the boundaries between the Patriarchate of Aquileia, the Principality of Pazin and the Republic of Venice. It is written in three linguistic versions: Latin, German and Croatian but our only existing copies are later Glagolitic transcripts. The original document from which later copies were made is dated 1275. However, the later copies include some 14th century additions, which clearly indicates that this old legal text was widely used. If we use a little imagination and look below the legal phrases and terminology the Istarski razvod can be seen as a prose text with several narrative levels composing a rich medieval fresco. It provides a whole procession of all the significant forms of the social life of medieval Istria moving through its magical landscape.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Theophilos Korydalleus (1570-1646) is considered to have been one of the most important Greek philosophers of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. His teaching and writings, especially his studies of Aristotle, had a great impact on Greek philosophy and his influence spread beyond the Greek world to the Balkan countries. The book discusses Aristotle's On generation and corruption. This particular edition of the work was supported financially by Panaretos, Bishop of Paphos (1767-1790), who in 1794 was proclaimed a Saint of the Greek Orthodox Church. The book was edited with an introduction by Archimandrite Kyprianos, one of the major Greek Cypriot intellectuals and clerics of the 18th century. Kyprianos' major work was the Chronological history of Cyprus (Venice, 1788). The publisher Nikolaos Glykis, founded and operated by a Greek family from Ioannina, Greece, published more than 1200 Greek books during their two hundred years of operation (1670-1854) in Venice.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise of the Heart, one of the so-called consoling writings of the last bishop of the Unitas Fratrum (Czech Brethren Church) and emigrant Jan Amos Komenský (1592-1670) belongs to the most favourite works of older Czech literature. During the author's life, this work was published twice (Leszno or Perno 1631 and Amsterdam 1663), while during the 17th and 18th centuries it was also distributed in many hand-written copies. Komenský (Comenius) wrote the Labyrinth in the period of time, when he - after having lost his family - found shelter from the religious persecution in the dominion of Karel starsí ze Zerotína in Brandýs nad Orlicí; The Latin dedication inserted into the first edition dates to 13 December 1623. The autograph of the work has not been preserved, the manuscript XVII.E.75 is the oldest copy made to meet Komenský's desire by two scribes of the Unitas Fratrum probably in 1623. The author himself corrected this copy (e.g. corrections and additions on pp. 19, 54, 57, 63, 74, 82) and probably even illustrated with a coloured drawing of a labyrinth (p. 9). The manuscript of 1623 having the title - as the first edition - Labirynt sveta a lusthauz srdce thus represents the first text version of the work; for both editions, the author made several changes and additions.The book, which unfortunately has not been preserved in its original binding, was dedicated by Komenský to his protector Karel st. ze Zerotína (1564-1636) whom also the first edition had been dedicated to. Zerotín's grand-son, Karel Bruntálský z Vrbna, bequeathed his books to the town of Vratislav (Breslau, Polish Wroclaw of today). The Zerotín's library was thus taken in 1641 to the library of the parish church of St. Maria Magdalena and it was transferred - together with this to the Vratislav City Library in the beginning of the 19thcentury which became later a component part of the University Library in Vratislav. The manuscript arrived to Prague in 1957, when the Polish government donated it to Czechoslovakia. Unfortunately, it had to be restored in 1988 because of the large corrosion of the writing material; at this time, it was also rebound in a new parchment binding. Sample illumination: The page no. 9 contains a full-page coloured drawing of the labyrinth considered as created by J. A. Komenský.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This Evangelistar was made at the instigation of Czech diplomats to honour an anniversary of the Czech King Vratislav's coronation of 1085. The manuscript is outstandingly rich in iconography. Its pictorial component ranks it among the most precious illuminated manuscripts of the second half of the 11th century in Europe. The codex is probably of the Danubian-area provenance, together with other codices -- two of them have been preserved in Poland and one in the Prague Capitol Library. They originated most likely in the circle of the Monastery of St. Emmerames scriptorium in Regensburg.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The codex of Prague provenance was created for Cunigund, the Abbess of the Convent of St. George, daughter of the King of the Czech lands Premysl Otakar II and sister of Wenceslas II. A mystical text of the codex was created by a Dominican, Kolda of Koldice; the Canon of St. George, Benes, was the scrivener of the codex and its illuminator. Both the illuminations and the text are original and are realized as non-framed, coloured drawings in bordures; regarding the style, they are influenced by contemporary Anglo-French visual art.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This illustrated alchemistic manuscript was written by Jaroš Griemiller z Trebska in 1578. It demonstrates the high level of alchemy that existed in Bohemia even before the transfer of the court of the emperor Rudolf II to Prague. It is a Czech translation of the medieval alchemic tract 'Rosarium philosophorum', made by Jaroš Griemiller, who was probably a relative of the country hallmark officer Pavel Griemiller z Trebska (+ 1593). He seemed to be inspired by his friend, the astronomer and alchemist Bavor ml. Rodovský z Hustiran (c. 1526-1592). His work was dedicated to a great benefactor of alchemic research, Vilém z Rožmberka (1535-1592). This Griemiller's autograph is rich in decoration and it has a representative golden leather binding. As such, it could be a volume made directly for the Rožmberk library.The ornamentation of the book is interesting not only thanks to the original alchemic iconography, but also thanks to its high artistic value that was not common for all alchemic manuscripts. A greater part of the 23 illustrations were probably created by one of the Rožmberk court painters, while Griemiller himself made perhaps only a few of them. From the iconographic point of view, the most distinct works are two miniatures on ff. 183v-184r. On the left side, there is a naked man with wings, standing on the moon and blowing a trumpet: he is raising the sun and the moon - which he has beheaded earlier with an axe - from the dead. It is an alchemic symbol of killing and resuscitation of the substance of the Great Work. On the opposite side, a naked queen is standing on two knolls from which two streamlets are running, while on the right side the sun has risen in the sky and on the left side the moon. This is an alchemic symbol of the two fundamental roots. The queen is holding burning torches and from her head a tree is growing with both arriving and departing birds that symbolize the central axis of alchemic art.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The instruments of Tycho Brahe represented a major breakthrough in astronomical science, because they enabled far more accurate readings than had previously been possible. These instruments aided observation of the stars and planets and the measurement of distances and ascensions. Tycho Brahe himself described his instruments in the book 'Astronomiæ instauratæ mechanica'. It was on the basis of Tycho Brahe's observations that Johannes Kepler determined the laws of planetary motion.Tycho Brahe was born in 1546, and started his studies at the University of Copenhagen at the age of twelve. In 1560 Tycho Brahe probably witnessed a partial solar eclipse, and from that time he began his studies of astronomy. He discovered large discrepancies between his own observations of the positions of the planets and the positions noted by astronomers before him. Between 1566 and 1570 he travelled and studied astronomy in Rostock, Wittenberg, Basel and Augsburg. During this period he constructed his first instruments (in 1564 a radius of wood and in 1569 the Great Quadrant at Augsburg). On November 11th, 1572 Tycho discovered a new bright star in Cassiopeia. Tycho published his observations on the star in a book, 'De Nova Stella'. This was what is known as a supernova today.King Frederick II offered Tycho Brahe generous financial support (more than 1% of Denmark's income) and the island of Hven as a fiefdom. In August 1576 he began building a combined manor and observatory at Uranienborg on Hven. When Frederick II died in 1596, Tycho Brahe lost most of his financial privileges. However he retained Hven as a fiefdom, despite criticism of his treatment of the peasants. In the spring of 1597, Tycho Brahe left Hven and half a year later took up residence at Wandesburg Castle at the invitation of Henrik Rantzau. There he printed a small edition of 'Astronomiæ instauratæ mechanica', which contains illustrations and descriptions of the most important of the instruments he had developed, as well as a brief survey of his theoretical results. Along with his catalogue of over 1,000 stars, the book was sent to a wide range of colleagues and princes. The leading astronomer in Europe was searching for a new employer.In 1598, Tycho Brahe accepted a proposal from Emperor Rudolf II that he come to Prague, where he was to work with Johannes Kepler. Tycho Brahedied in 1601 and is buried in Prague. The Royal Library presents a digital facsimile of the 'Astronomiæ instauratæ mechanica' at its website:</dc:description>

The main translator of the Bible was Anton Thor Helle (1683-1748), a clergyman and writer, the developer of the Estonian written language. The translation of the Bible into the North-Estonian language strengthened its position to become the common written language in Estonia. The baroque title page is in red-and-black and the engraved frontispiece with the scenes from the Bible has been printed in St.Petersburg, Russia, engraved by the Russian artist of the Italian origin Philipp Mattarnovy after the drawing of C.H.

The author of the book Heinrich Stahl (a.1600-1657), a German clergyman born in Tallinn, has played an important part in founding the Estonian written language, he has written the first Estonian grammar book. The book with the German title "Leyen Spiegel" and the German parallel text was addressed to the local German pastors in the first place. The book was printed in Tallinn by H.Westphal in 1641 and 1649 in two parts. At the beginning of the 18th century the present copy of the National Library of Estonia has belonged to the churchwarden's assistant, a peasant from the seaside village of North-Estonia, Taberla Jost. The title page of the first part reproduced here is decorated with the wood cut border and a vignette.</dc:description>

The main translators of the New Testament were the pastors Johann Hornung (1660-1715) and Adrian Virginius (1663-1706). The book was printed in Tallinn by the printing office of J.C. Brendeken. Only 400 copies were printed and so it has become very rare. The preface in German gives a historical survey of the earlier prints in Estonian. The title page shows a woodcut of the panorama of Tallinn, most probably the work of a local master.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The 'Cosmographia' or 'Geographia' (Geographike hyphegesis in origin), a work of the ancient Greek geographer and astronomer Claudius Ptolemy who lived in Alexandria, was written in about AD 160. The work provided a foundation for acquiring and organizing information on the whole known world. It contains about 8000 place names for which Ptolemy gives the necessary details for placing them on a map. Different versions of manuscripts in Latin translation have been preserved, and 55 printed editions before 1900 are known, the first beeing printed in 1475 in Vicenza without maps. The A. E. Nordenskiöld Collection contains 49 different (53 altogether) printed editions of Ptolemy, for instance all seven from 15th century, and one manuscript edition. This edition of 1482 is printed in Ulm, and the text is based on the Latin translation by Jacobus Angelus and edited by Dominus Nicolaus Germanus. It is the first woodcut Ptolemaic edition, and the world map is the first signed printed map.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Elias Tillandz (1640-1693), professor of medicine at the Academy of Turku, published the first flora of Finland, 'Catalogus plantarum' in 1673. Only one copy of the Catalogus is known. The second edition was published in 1683, and it was amended with an illustrated book 'Icones novae'. It contains 159 plants growing in the area of Turku, Western Finland. The artist of the woodcut drawings is not known but he is supposed probably to be Daniel Medelplan, working at that time as an engraver at the Academy of Turku.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The second book printed for use in Finland, 'Manuale Aboense', was printed in Halberstadt in 1522 by Laurentius Stuchs. The book was unknown for several centuries until in 1844 some pages of the book were found. It was printed both on paper and on parchment, and from the parchment fragments it was possible to reconstruct two whole books, of which one is placed in The National Library of Finland and the other in the Royal Library in Stockholm. The only book printed on paper was found in this century. It belongs to the archives of the church of Lohja and is now placed in The National Library of Finland.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The first edition of the Finnish Bible, the New Testament translated into Finnish by Michael Agricola, was published in 1548. The publishing of the Bible realized the principle of the Reformation that anyone should be able to read the Word of God in his native language. Michael Agricola is the creator of the written Finnish language; he also wrote the first Finnish ABC Book in 1543. The New Testament was printed in Stockholm by Amund Laurentsson and the edition was approximately 500 copies of which 120 copies are known today. The typography of the book follows German patterns. The 83 different fine woodcut illustrations originate from German printing houses. Most of them are copies of the pictures made for Martin Luther's Bible translations in the studio of Lucas Cranach the Elder.</dc:description>

There are approximately 2000 of these manuscripts, comprising some 20.000 pages of music. The collection, which contains material both published and unpublished, has been accumulated partly by purchasing individual manuscripts from various sources, partly by depositions and donations. The most important donation by far was made by the Sibelius family in 1982. Through this generous gi</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The first version of Jean Sibelius's 'Fifth Symphony' was premiered under the composer's direction at the concert celebrating his fiftieth birthday on December 8, 1915. Sibelius had begun composing the work in the summer of 1914 on his return from the successful tour in the United States. After the first performance, Sibelius began to rework the composition. The second version, of which there are only some traces in the documentary material, was presented the following year, December 1916. The Symphony received its final form only in 1919. By comparison with the expressionism and dark, harsh orchestral colors of Symphony no. 4, Symphony no. 5 is sunny, imbued with the spirit of nature, and turned outward. Despite some chromaticism, the composer returned to tonality. Behind the 'Fifth Symphony''s classic façade, however, hides some of the progressive elements of the 'Fourth Symphony'. While he was working on the 'Fifth Symphony', Sibelius was also working on Symphonies no. 6 and 7. In a letter from the year 1918, he wrote: "It seems as though I am presenting myself with all three symphonies at once. As always, the sculptural element is ever more conspicuous in my music."</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The first book printed for use in Finland, 'Missale Aboense', was printed in Lübeck in 1488 by Bartholomeus Ghotan at the behest of Konrad Bitz, who at that time was Bishop of Turku (Åbo) and thus of the whole of Finland. Bitz's preface is dated August 17, 1488. Copies of the Missal were printed both on paper and on parchment. In the book the main text is printed in black and the rubrics in red, and there are decorative initials. Many of them are painted in blue and red by hand. The most obvious reference to Finland can be seen in the coloured woodcut representing BishopHenrik, the patron saint of the Finnish Church, accompanied by the figures of Bishop Konrad Bitz, Dean Maunu Särkilahti and two priests. The picture also contains the coat of arms of the Bock family to whom Bitz was related, and Ghotan's initials and armorial device. At the feet of Bishop Henrik lies his murderer, the Finnish peasant Lalli. The fact that the Missal was intended for use in Finland is also evident from the calendar of saints' days and a section of specific mass chants. The text of the Missal follows the Dominican rite.As a result of the Reformation in the first half of the 16th century the collections of the medieval literature of Finland were destroyed. Of the copies of 'Missale Aboense' printed on paper no complete copy has survived; but 15 incomplete copies have been found. A single original parchment copy of 'Missale Aboense' has survived in Det Kongelige Bibliotek, the national library of Denmark, and from the parchment fragments preserved in Finland it has been possible to reconstruct entire books.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>In December 1856, when his relationship with Michel Lévy, the publisher of his Poe translations, was going through a difficult period, Charles Baudelaire suddenly turned towards Auguste Poulet-Malassis, a young printer at Alençon, in Normandy. The poet entrusted his future friend with the task of printing and publishing a book of verse, largely made up of pieces put together during the previous five years, and which had up until that point only appeared in periodicals. Poulet-Malassis had the reputation of being an honest publisher and also - whatwas to be the deciding factor - an elegant typographer. The object was to make a book together, insisted Baudelaire, 'a volume of good, if little, material, which would look substantial and well shown off'. Since the manuscript, prepared by a copyist, has disappeared, along with almost the complete set of corrected galley proofs, which were probably too soiled to be retained, these page proofs are today the only document which allows us to reconstruct the genesis of Les Fleurs du mal, from the withdrawal of the first dedication to Théophile Gautier, on March 8, 1857, until the last corrections after mid-May. Circulating back and forth between Alençon and Paris, they attest to the attentive care taken by the author to the spelling (moderatly traditional), to the punctuation (according to the meaning, but also to the 'declamation'), and to the layout. They record Poulet-Malassis' questions and his entreaties (angrily crossed out by Baudelaire) to correct and quickly return the last galley proofs. Moreover, the poet's notes and recommendations are evidence of his tension at this crucial period, and of the anxiety which made him indifferent towards the exasperation of the publisher whom he had chosen, as he reminded him, because they both shared the idea 'that in any kind of production, nothing else was admissible except perfection'.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The International Exhibition for Book Industry and Book Printing Craft (BUGRA) of 1914 together with a world culture show, an exposition of contemporary book art and applied graphics and specialised exhibitions was the first comprehensive demonstration of the achievements of the book industry. 22 countries presented themselves, of which five had national exhibitions in own premises. From Germany alone participated 2 300 firms and persons. However, the breaking out of the First World War prevented the continuation of the idea that Bugra could be a contribution towards the further cultural development of nations. Walter Tiemann, who decisively inspired the development of the typography and book design, produced the layouts for posters, postcards, tickets, special stamps for the Bugra. Tieman merits special mention as teacher and as director (from 1920 onwards) at the Leipzig Academy for Graphic Arts and Book Craft and with his intensive creativity for the Insel Verlag.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Johann Gottlieb Immanuel Breitkopf, who led the family's letterpress and publishing firm to great standing, occupied himself also with numerous theoretical and practical questions of book production. Apart from his successful development of a special system for music printing, in which a detachable part of the music type could be composed together with the cast parts of the rulework, he was also an innovator in the area of printed letters and of map printing. Well preserved are his three attempts of type-setting and printing of maps he had published between 1777 and 1779. His idea to make the production of maps more efficient by substituting the traditional method of copper plates with a movable system of types did not assert itself in practise. Towards the end of 18th century it was lithography invented by Alois Senefelder that became the starting point for the further development of map printing.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Thomas Offhaus, born 1967 in Gotha, graduated in Art/German studies in Erfurt, and was a teaching staff member from 1993-1996 in Leipzig at the Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst. Since 1995 he has been working as an independent artist. His artistic creations cover a wide spectrum and reach from painting to graphic art via artist books up to installations and musical presentations. Thomas Offhaus has already produced a considerable number of art books, some published electronically in the form of cd-roms. He uses a multiplicity of graphic art techniques and their combinations with one another. Frequently he finishes with painting over the pictures.'Sein letzter Schritt. Mein Zögern' ('His last step. My hesitation') from the year 2000 shows a very close relationship between the textual and visual components that constitute this work of art. The artistic book arose out of the work on a graphic interpreting a text by Volker Braun: 'Lyotard oder Die Leute lassen sich alles erzählen' ('Lyotard or people will believe anything'). There Offhaus encounters Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' and is inspired to produce an individual art book based on a single passage that hasas a central issue the ambivalence in which the high-grade nervous balance between belief in progress, hope and madness up to death is depicted. Browsing through the book one can discover a distinctive motif on each single page. It is 'The Hesitant', the figure of a pacing man. According to Offhaus this figure has the 'potential to do one step' and is becoming conscious of this condition. He considers this biographical symbol in Conrad's text as being equivalent in form and content and decides to vary the picture of the figure on as many etching plates as possible.As the text points to an 'eternal moment', a moment of insight and assessment, everything speaks against a linear unfolding or a series of pictures. The same plates show up again and again, but their constellation modifies according to page and position within the text. The text moves - as if it were on terraces - in a blank between, above and beneath the plates through the whole book. First the etchings were printed, followed by the wood carvings. The text is inserted with single letter types. Offhaus, who considers painting and music as homogenous in his creation intends to complete the book with music. During work a rhythmic structure emerges - in relation to the etching plates - to which Offhaus approximates himself in an 'eruptive, spontaneous and wild manner which at time can also be rather hesitant'.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Karli Frigge was born 1943 in Batenburg. Since 1964 she is dedicating herself to the art of marbling and bookbinding craft. 'The most important lesson she learned from her tutor must have been to think for herself and to develop her own style. Karli Frigge is extremely systematic and writes down every change in her technique, leaving nothing to chance. She helps maintain her concentration by devoting the summer month to marbling and the winter to bookbinding' (Phoebe Jane Easton). Karli Frigge's point of departure is more artistic than from the traditional craftmanship. Often she combines marbling with calligraphic elements. Her strong point are multiple marblings of outmost delicacy and transparency.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>It is the first publication of the Homer's epics and hymns. Bernando and Nerio Nerli brothers financed the publication mentioned above. Dimitrios Chalkokondilis, who was teacher of Ancient Greek at the University of Florence at that time, edited this publication from the philological point of view. The printer was the Cretan Demitrios Damilas, who had also inscribed well-drawn and legible printing characters. It has old bookbinding, wooden covers dressed with parchment and bronze doors. The coat of arms is painted in the margin of the bottom of the page 2o A1 a without any chronological or other indication.The text includes the plot of the first rhapsody of Homer's 'Iliad' as well as the beginning of the same rhapsody concerning Achilles' wrath caused by Agamaemnon's behavior. The reason of this wrath was Agamemnon's refusal to give Chryses, the priest of Apollo, his daughter Chryseis, who had been captured by the Acheaens and had been given to Agamemnon as a honorable gift. This fact as well as Agamemnon's bad behavior towards Chryses angered Apollo, who for this reason sent a plague to the Greek's camp. Achilles mustered the Greek's army and Chalkas, the diviner, revealed the root of evil to them. Achilles asked for the propitiation of God and Agamemnon gave Chryseis back to her father Chryses after he had argued with Achilles. Furthermore, he took for himself Bryseis, Achilles' honorable gift from the Acheaens too. Achilles, who became angry because of this fact, asked from his mother, the goddess Thetis, to influence Zeus in order to help the Trojans to defeat the Greeks trying in this way to honor and satisfy himself as well. Upon realizing this, Hera, who was on the Acheaens' side, provoked Zeus during the meeting of Gods. The quarrel between Hera and Zeus came to the end when Hephaestus offered all of Gods abundant wine as cup-bearer, changing in this way their temper. The publication of Homer's works is one of the most important achievements of the Renaissance.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>'The Large Etymological Dictionary' is the first book which was released by the first Greek-owned press in Venice, that of Nikolaos Vlastos, who was scholar, scriber and the offspring of a Byzantine family. Zaharias Kalliergis, who was also scholar and scriber, undertook the drawing of the family of the elaborate printing characters, trying in this way to transfer the character and the tradition of the Byzantine codices into the Greek incunabula. Furthermore, he was the head of the printing house. Anna Notara, who was the daugther of the Grand Duke of Constantinople, Loukas Notaras, supported the Greek books' publication and lent them imperial splendour through her financial contribution.Bound in green leather and printed with gilt-edged decoration by Joseph Drechsler in Vienna, 'The Large Etymological Dictionary' is the one of the most important Byzantine Dictionaries. It is not the exact copy of the original one but it is enriched by other sources. The publication mentioned above is characterized by its artistry. It is adorned with two different lines of initials and three woodcuts, that were used as headings and at the same time crown the text at the beginning of every chapter. This decoration as well as the ornamental initials were printed in red ink. In addition, the publisher's devices of Kalliergis and Vlastos complete the decoration. These devices are also printed in red ink at the colophon of the book. Kalliergis chose the two-headed eagle with the initials of his name ZK as a device. On the other hand, Vlastos chose a composition consisting of his name and surname and the creeping vineyard at the top of which the cross, the symbol of the Orthodoxy, was drawn. It is considered one of the monuments of the Greek typography of the fifteenth century.</dc:description>

Rigas Velestinlis (1757-1798) was the apostle of the National Revolution, the proto-martyr of the enslaved Greeks, the architect of the neo-Hellenic Enlightnment and the dreamer of the Greek Democracy.The Chart, which is a physical, historical and political one, presents elaborately the geographical characteristics of the Balkans' Peninsula as well as those of Asia Minor. It is an art gallery with ancient Greek place-names beside the neo-Hellenic names, 162 drawn Greek coins with graphics and two-dimensional representations of ten important cities. In addition, it presents historical, archeological and political events and at the same time looms up the radiance of the ancient and modern Hellenism. There is an alphabetic catalogue of the names of the famous creators of the ancient Greek civilization in the margin of the top and the bottom of the Chart.The drawing up of the Chart as 'a historical and geographical of our own country encyclopedia' had the intention to teach the enslaved Greeks of 'what they had, what they have, what they should have', to represent to his contemporaries their ancestral history and glory in general, to awake the love and interest concerning the heritage of their ancestors, to strengthen their national self-knowledge and to stimulate their self-esteem regarding their liberation and the rebirth of the Greek civilization.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>John Sibthorp (1758-1796), English botanist, has been a professor of botany at Oxford University. He carried out two botanical expeditions to the mainland of Greece, to the insular Greece, to Cyprus and to Asia Minor in order to collect Greek plants and flowers. The first of the two expeditions took place between 1786 and 1787 and the second one between 1794-1795. In the first expedition, John Sibthorp was accompanied by the Austrian artist Ferdinand Lukas Bauer (1760-1826), who undertook to draw the Greek plants and flowers. Sibthorp died of tuberculosis in 1796, during his second expedition, without completing his work. However, shortly before his death he drew up his will, according to which, Sibthorp bequeathed the whole of his property to the Oxford University on condition that the income which would come from the exploitation of his fortune would be allocated to the publication of 'Flora Graecae', in 10 folio volumes and an octavo Prodromus to the work, without plates.Besides the 'Flora Oxoniensis', which was published by Sibthorp himself in 1794 and shows Sibthorp to have been thoroughly critical botanist, he shared in the post-humous 'Flora Graeca' and 'Florae Graecae Prodromus'. The latter was issued in two volumes 8o in 1806 and 1813 respectively by his friend and botanist Dr.James Ed-ward Smith (1759-1828). Dr Smith undertook the publication of 'Flora Graeca Sibthorpiana' in collaboration with the botanist and the executor of his will, John Haw-kins (1761-1841). They published six volumes between 1806 and Smith's death in 1828. As regards the seventh volume, it was published in 1830.The eighth, ninth and tenth volumes, edited by the botanist Dr John Lindley (1799-1865), were published between 1833 and 1840. Each volume includes 100 plates except the last one, which includes 66, and was engraved by James Sowerby. In addition, it includes index and tables with scientific and common Greek names of plants. Only thirty complete copies of this edition were issued to subscribers, the price of each being 240 guineas. A reis-sue of forty more copies was published by Bohn in 1845-6 under the supervision of Dr. Daubeny.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The most precious Hungarian cimelium for both its historical and artistic values. The manuscript is the most important historical and illumination relic of court and knightly culture in Hungary during the Anjou dinasty. The Chronicle recounts the history of the Hungarians from the appearance of the Huns in Pannonia. It ends with the military campaign in Wallachia in 1333. According to the foreword, the author of the text, identified in the literature as Márk Kálti, began work on the chronicle in 1358.The text is accompanied by 39 miniatures, 4 medallions with scenes, 98 initials with figures or scenes and 5 ornamental initials. The illuminations often show a version of the history of the Hungarians which differs from the text. The illustrations present the events at several levels, among others sketching the history and lineage of the Árpád dynasty and the Anjous and also following the path of the holy crown. In creating the compositions the artist drew on illuminations in earlier chronicles and on paintings with a religious theme. The style is that of royal courts in Central Europe. The volume was made for Louis the Great.</dc:description>

		<dc:type>Manuscript</dc:type>
		<dc:subject>History</dc:subject>
		<dc:description>The most important, and world-famous bibliographic and art history relic of the Renaissance in Hungary is the Buda library of King Matthias (1458-1490). Even the contemporaries regarded the library in Buda as a unique collection, both for richness of content and artistic quality, and the king as a reviver of Antiquity, a generous patron of learning and the arts. When the king died in 1490 the library had reached its full splendour; from 1485 the collecting had been on a greater scale than ever before. The manuscripts were kept in two library rooms in the eastern part of the palace, beside the royal chapel. According to some sources the Latin and Greek works were kept separately. The books lay on their front covers on shelves along the walls, protected from the dust with gold brocade. In the centre of the rooms stood three-legged chairs made after antique models. At that time the collection probably contained 1500-2000 volumes, covering all areas of the Renaissance ideal of culture and approaching its notion of a universal library. Under Matthias' successors new items were added to the library only very occasionally and ambassadors coming to Buda could hope with good chances of success to acquire a manuscript for themselves, perhaps even one of the most valuable. However, this ensured that at least these codices escaped the total destruction that happened when the Turks occupied Buda.Today we know of 216 surviving authentic Corvinas, scattered throughout the world's major collections. This manuscript was made in Naples between 1490 and 1492. The arms of Wladislas II and Tamás Bakócz, Archbishop of Esztergom, can be seen beneath the miniature. Researchers have not agreed on the purpose and origin of the manuscript. According to one point of view, the arms of Bakócz were painted over those of Beatrix when a fellow Dominican gave the codex to the archbishop in Rome in 1512-13 from the legacy of Ransano. In this case the original arms emphasised the need for a marriage between Wladislas and Beatrix. According to the other point of view, there is no proof that the armsof Beatrix originally figured on the sheet - which is in any case not the title-page - and thus it is doubtful whether the author intended the manuscript for the royal library. Ransanus (+ 1492), Bishop of Lucera, came to Buda in 1488 as ambassador of the Kingdom of Naples to support Beatrix's aspirations to succession. He wrote the 'Epitoma' during his stay in Hungary. It is a short summary of Hungarian history, a supplement to the world history on which he had been working since the middle of the century. The 'Epitoma' is the first work of Hungarian history to have been written in the humanist spirit.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Sumptuous manuscript with a gilded double title-page. The codex contains works by the Athenian Sophist Philostratos (3rd century AD) and his nephew: biographies of heroes and philosophers of Antiquity, letters and a description of the paintings in a Neapolitan gallery. Bonfini translated the work into Latin for the royal library in 1487. The manuscript reached Buda from Florence in Matthias' lifetime, but the leather binding with architectonic ornamentation bears the arms of Wladislas II.'The Philostratus Corvina' is one of the most finely decorated manuscripts of the royal library and its title-page has the greatest wealth of decorative elements, in the all' antica style: medals, cameos, architectonic elements, mythological scenes and a triumph. Some scholars consider that the person holding the triumphal procession is János Corvin, an indication of Matthias' ideas for the succession. A portrait of Matthias can be seen among the medal portraits of Roman emperors in the frame on the left-hand sheet. In addition to the title-page, the manuscript has a further six title-pages, placed at the beginning of the different works, with decorative borders and figural initials. A number of researchers had thought the miniaturist to be Attavante degli Attavanti, but it is now unanimously agreed to be the work of the Florentine master Boccardino il Vecchio (died 1529).</dc:description>

		<dc:description>János Thuróczi (died c. 1488-89) wrote his history of Hungary in 1487. The work was printed in 1488 in Brünn and again in the same year in Augsburg. The publisher of the Augsburg edition dedicated the work to Matthias and used gold paint for the dedication of this luxury copy printed on parchment. Today this is the first known book printed with gold paint. The same paint was used to illuminate the painting of a scene from the legend of Saint Ladislas and the arms. The volume also contains numerous hand-coloured woodcuts of Hungarian kings and battle scenes.</dc:description>

The printer, András Hess, came to Buda from Rome at the invitation of László Karai, provost of Buda and vice-chancellor. He printed this chronicle in the workshop set up in the Buda Castle, using type from the Laurer press in Rome, then another book which contained two works: Basilius Magnus, "De legendis poetis" and Xenophon, "Apologia Socratis". Eleven copies of the chronicle are known to exist, two of them in Hungary: the one shown here preserved in the National Széchényi Library and another in the Budapest University Library. It was the first book printed in Hungary.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>'The Funeral Oration and Prayer' is the first known continuous prose text in Hungarian and in the entire Finno-Ugrian language family. The 32-line funeral oration is a free translation of the sermon found in the volume, making use of rhetorical elements borowed from Latin. In contrast the Prayer is a fixed text faithful to the Latin model. The codex itself contains, among others, a missal, an Easter mystery play, songs with musical notation, synodic laws from the time of King Coloman, and the oldest Hungarian annals known as the Pozsony Yearbooks. The latter lists the Hungarian kings up to 1210. A tinted ink drawing of the Passion makes this precious relic even more valuable. The manuscript bears the name of György Pray (1723-1801), the first to make a scholarly study of it.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Guðbrandur Þorláksson (1541/42-1627) studied at the cathedral school at Hólar in the north of Iceland before attending the University of Copenhagen. After he returned home, Gudbrandur was appointed rector of the school at Skálholt in the south of Iceland for a three year term, and then minister at Breidabólstadur in the north of Iceland until he himself became bishop of Hólar, a position he held until his death in 1627. He was an energetic editor and publisher. A total of 80 books are known to have been printed while he was bishop. These were chiefly religious works, the Bible of course being the largest and most important, but his worldly books included the 'Lawbook of Icelanders', published in 1578.Gudbrandur's Bible consists of 662 folio leaves, each 29 x 19 cm (including marginal references and notes). It is said that it took seven men two years to print it. Originally 500 copies were printed, of which there are still between 30 and 40 copies extant in Iceland, one third of them held in private ownership. It is not known how many copies have been preserved outside Iceland. The book is divided into three sections, first the Old Testament (ff. 6 + 295), then the Prophets (ff. 4 + 192), and then the New Testament (ff. 1 + 123 + 1). A foreign bookbinder was hired, and he bound half of the number printed. An additional 120 copies were sent to Copenhagen to be bound and the rest were assigned to an Icelander who had learned bookbinding from the foreigner. The book was expensive, the price equivalent to two to three cows. Each church was required to purchase a copy of this Bible, and in addition the publication was supported by a Royal grant. This Bible was printed with schwabacher lettering, like most books in Iceland at that time. The letters are clear and most of the printing was very well done. Regarded as an innovation in Icelandic publishing for the time, Gudbrandur's Bible features 29 woodcuts (of which two are printed twice); it has been shown that the bishop acquired them from abroad. The decorated initial letters and the ornaments were quite conceivably made by the bishop himself, as it is known that he was an accomplished carver.Bishop Gudbrandur made an important contribution to the translation of the Bible, though others had already translated specific parts into Icelandic. The fact that the Bible and other Lutheran books appeared so early in Icelandic, helped to ensure the continuity of the language of the ancient Icelandic literature down to our own time. Bishop Gudbrandur was well educated and in addition to theology, was interested in mathematics, astronomy and geography; in this connection he made a map of Iceland, the first that was close to presenting the real configuration of the land. Two facimile editions of Gudbrandur's Bible have appeared, in 1956-57 and again in 1984.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>An extant parchment leaf from a manuscript called 'Kringla'; the oldest and best of the manuscripts of the huge set of historical sagas of the kings of Norway known as 'Heimskringla', written by Snorri Sturluson (1178-1241). Snorri, an Icelandic thirteenth-century writer, was in his time the most prestigious writer in Scandinavia and 'Heimskringla' one of his most important works. The 'Kringla' manuscript, from which this fragment survived, was destroyed in the great fire that swept Copenhagen in the autumn of 1728 amongst a number of other Icelandic manuscripts. The leaf was found in the Royal Library in Stockholm, as an Icelander who made a copy of 'Heimskringla' in the late 17th century to sell to Sweden, has taken one leaf from the original manuscript as proof for the copy's authenticity of the National Library of Iceland.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Giraldus de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis (of Wales) was a priest who made two visits to Ireland soon after the Norman invasion. He wrote two largely propagandist works, intended to justify the conquest by portraying the Irish as primitive and degenerate. His 'Topographia Hiberniae' includes this schematic map of Europe, the earliest in the Library's collection. The sources of the map are European rather than Norman and it was probably copied from a contemporary 'mappa mundi' (map of the world). The coverage of Ireland, however, is largely confined to the area of Norman influence; the map may be taken as representing in general terms the contemporary Norman understanding of the country. Scotland, England and Wales, Iceland and Ireland are framed between Norway to the left, and Spain and the south of France to the right. The rivers Liffey, Slaney, Suir and Shannon are shown with their ports: Dublin, Wexford, Waterford and Limerick, all of which were Norman centres. The Shannon and the Erne appear as one river, a confusion probably arising from the fact that their sources are in the same general area; the confusion suggests that the North-west was not well documented in the cartographer's sources. Detail is also limited for Britain where the only cities or towns to appear are York, Lincoln, London and Winchester. The map may have originated as a guide for travellers from England to Rome. The route probably led via the Seine and Paris, across the Rhone at Lyon, across the Alps to Pavia, and from there to Piacenza and Rome.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This is one of a number of Counter-Reformation religious texts in Irish published outside Ireland in the seventeenth century for the use of Catholics in Ireland. They were intended as a riposte to other religious works in Irish which the Reformed Church was circulating for proselytizing purposes. O hEodhasa (c.1575-1614) was from the diocese of Clogher and entered the Franciscan college at Louvain in 1607. He became involved in designing a font of Irish type, presumably based on his own rather irregular style of handwriting, which was first used to print his catechism. The printing was done at a printing house in Antwerp, but that same year the Franciscans set up their own press at Louvain. The catechism is open at the Ten Commandments.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Vinegar Hill, located near the town of Enniscorthy in County Wexford, was the main camp of the Wexford rebels in the insurrection against English rule in 1798. On 21 June it was successfully stormed by a force of 10,000 men under the British general Gerard Lake. The battle is remembered as the decisive defeat of the Wexford rebels. The 5th Princess Charlotte of Wales Dragoon Guards depicted here were more generally known as the Old Green Horse. According to a note on the verso of the print, the regiment distinguished itself at the Battle of Salamanca. Sadler's depictions of the 1798 rebellion are significant because they are almost certainly based on descriptions by his uncle who served in the Queen's Own Royal Dublin Militia.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This codex is a part of the precious Galileo collection. In 1822 the collection, after many different events, was sold by the Nelli to the Grand Duke Ferdinando III. He acquired the collection for the Palatina Library and provided for its rearrangement with his wife Maria Luisa and the Prince Leopoldo, who was personally interested in science. The collection includes Galileo's autographical works and other autographs of those, mostly scientists, who were important in his education, studies and scientific heritage. There is a great number of letters in Galileo's own hand, and between his followers and the most important scientists of that period.The codex Galileiano 48 is, like many others of that collection, miscellaneous and it includes, between lf. 8 and lf. 38, the draft by Galileo of 'Sidereus Nuncius', written in three days after his astronomical observations in January 1610 and published in Venice in March of the same year. Here Galileo makes the announcement in Latin, following the most popular theory, of the discovery of satellites around the planet Jupiter as a reult of astronomical observation with the telescope. Lf. 28r is representing the phases of Jupiter's satellites. Preliminary to publication of 'Sidereus Nuncius', Galileo obtained these images by using the telescope in the observations of this planet.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The author was born in Bologna and died in Rome, in 1811, at the age of 55. Very little is known about him. The collection's title is 'Costumi romani'. It includes 30 drawings: only two of them are signed and dated 1810, while the others are only titled and numbered by the author. The drawing n. 7, reproduced above, represents the animated café at the ground floor of Palazzo Fiano (at the corner of Via del Corso and Piazza S. Lorenzo in Lucina). A theater was in its basement; it was well-known for dancing and music puppet perfomances. Cassandrino, the famous mask-character, was the king of the stage at Fiano Theater, It is mentioned in two sonnets by the Roman poet Giuseppe Gioachino Belli and in Giacomo Leopardi's Paralipomeni.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The drawing, reproducing Bernini's masterpiece, belongs to the most important and consistent collection of drawings by Van Wittel (Amersfoort, 1655 - Rome, 1736). The famous Dutch painter, who lived and worked in Italy, conceived many of these 52 drawings to prepare his paintings. They can reach unusual large dimensions (width about one meter) and some of them are almost worn out by the artist's use. The Library divided the collection into various groups of works, according to the different views represented: Vedute di Roma, Vedute dei dintorni di Roma, Vedute di altre città d'Italia e Vedute diverse. No date appears on the Fontana dei Fiumi. Although it is a preparatory drawing, it is not yet possible to correlate it with any painting. Van Wittel drew it on a squared paper and wrote some words in Dutch on the facades of buildings and at the base of the obelisk ("Moer hoger sgn"). The fountain is viewed from Saint Agnes' Church, according to a perspective very unusual in Van Wittel's works.</dc:description>

The 'Zibaldone' contains a miscellanea concerning scientific, historical and literary subjects, composed by the Roman poet in order to train his son Ciro; the author himself states his pedagogical purposes and methods. This work has no particular literary and scientific value, but it testifies Belli's interest in all branches of knowledge and particularely in European pedagogy. It consists of 4525 numerated cards in nine volumes and of two volumes of indices. It is a sort of universal encyclopedia which takes information from essays and also from Italian and foreign newspapers and magazines. It contains notes, tables, schemes, together with sketches. The ibis reproduced above (Vol.VI, fol. 235v) is the only water colour drawing in the miscellanea.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>'Historia Augusta' is the title traditionally given to this collection of biographies of the Roman emperors from Hadrian (117-138 A.D.) to Carus, Carinus and Numerianus (284 A.D.); it goes back to the end of the 4th century. In the manuscript tradition the biographies are attributed to six different historians, othewise unknown; but nowadays most scholars believe that it was the work of a single author, who used different pseudonyms.This really gorgeous parchment manuscript was problably written in Rome in the last decades of the 15th century, but it shows a strong influence of the Paduan school and particularly of Mantegna in the classic elements of the decoration. The first page of each biography presents a very rich decoration in gold and colours mostly consisting of an architectural frame together with leaves, flowers, fruits, candelabra, cornucopiae, sphynxes, caryatids, satyrs, putti. One of the main features of the decoration are the golden coins and medals with portraits of the emperors. The first lines of each biography are written in capitals, alternatively in gold and colours (green, blue, red, yellow, violet). The illumination has been attributed to the 'Master of the Vatican Homer' (Vat. gr. 1626), who was identified as Gaspare Romano (Gaspare da Padova) or Bartolomeo Sanvito. In the Vatican Homer the Latin translation was written by Bartolomeo Sanvito; the golden and coloured lines in capitals in our manuscript are typical of Bartolomeo Sanvito and have been attributed to him. A connection of our manuscript with Sanvito is therefore undoubted. The binding has a brown morocco cover which presents four golden frames with a central almond, where the owner's arms weree housed (they were unfortunately removed); it recalls some manuscripts made for Giovanni d'Aragona.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The author of the poster 'Francijas modernas makslas izstade 1939' ('French modern art exhibition 1939') is the outstanding French artist Raoul Dufy (1877-1953). R. Dufy, in his manner so characteristic for the 30-ties, is ironically showing the inciting objects of artist's imagination. An easel with a cardboard ready for work and a palette of colours are depicted in the foreground of the work. So, that any of the objects seen around can be eternalized on it: a model in the open air, monuments of architecture, the train surrounded by the puff of smoke, the motive of a road or a scenery of the sunshine in general. This is the art that has developed under the influence of impressionists, when light of painting in the open air became one of the main objects of adoration. Thus the environment depicted in the poster corresponded to the line of the exhibition and the Latvian public could give its estimation to French painting and graphic arts of the 20th century.The poster, in a way, became a signal of active art life in Riga, where beginning with the 20th century regular art exhibitions were organized. This was the first and for the time beeing the only one so large French art exhibition in Latvia. The works of 73 authors were exhibited there. In 1939 a large Latvian art exhibition was opened in Paris, too. The history of the printing of the poster is very interesting: the part of the picture was made in Paris, but the textual part of it– in Statepaper printing house in Latvia. Therefore, it is possible that the letters for the visual part have been made by some Latvian artist.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The poster 'Danijas makslas izstade Riga' ('Danish art exhibition in Riga'), is made by the prominent Latvian graphic artist Sigismuds Vidbergs (1890-1970), who has worked in the field of easel and applied graphics, painting on porcelain, book and magazine illustrations and commercial drawings. In this poster manifesting on the Danish art exhibition the artist affirms the creative cultural ties with the Northern countries, that developed at the time of the Republic of Latvia. It was the first great Danish painting and sculpture exhibition in Latvia. The exposition included the works of 51 authors and gave an insight into Danish art beginning at the end of the 19th century.Vidberg's poster is a fascinating example of the manifestation of Danish art at the exhibition in Riga. The number of pictorial elements in the poster has been reduced to a minimum, thus giving preference to the effective exaggeration of their proportions. And, of course, it attracts impressively the attention of the public. But in fact the general attention should be focused on the subject – the Danish flag which, like a sail filled out, is flapping in the wind over the long ship of the Vikings, that is sailing in the direction of Riga - the capital of Latvia. The stylization and geometric simplification of the forms of the objects and their emphasized diagonal position are the features of Art Deco style; thus, the experience of Modernism has been creatively adopted. The presence of this tradition is witnessed by the layout of the text that is forming a geometric pattern, the proportions of which are harmonized with a picture itself and the blank areas in it. By changing the size of the letters Vidbergs has successfully emphasised the information that is essential for the general public on the possibilities to attend the exhibition and details about the admission fee. The colours used in the poster are strikingly minimal and are chosen for maximum visual impact. The red Danish banner, the dark hull of the ship, the blue letters and the stylized depiction of waves are successfully contrasting with the plain white. The depiction of the blue edge of the cloud in the upper part of the poster is witness of Vidbergs role as an aesthete whose style was often playful decorative. Here this decorative interpretation has something in common with the playfull stylization of waves in the optical centre of the composition. This work of Vidbergs is one of the most brilliant examples of Art Deco in Latvian poster art.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The author of the poster 'Dziesmu svetki Riga' ('Song festival in Riga') is the well known Latvian artist Niklavs Strunke (1894-1966), who alongside with graphic arts has also worked in the field of stage designing and painting. N. Strunke's creative work has been influenced by different styles, the main of them are – Cubism, Constructivism, Futurism and the "New Manner". Beginning with the second half of the 20th century these influencies are mainly connected with the stylization methods characteristic for Art Deco. It is well seen in the poster of Song festival. The tradition of song festival began in Germany and in lands close to it – in Austria and Switzerland at the beginning of the 19th century. This tradition very soon took roots also in the Baltic provinces which at that time were a part of Russia's empire, but which still had a considerable autonomy. The first Baltic German chorus festival took place in Riga in 1861. 21 choirs participated in it. Two day activities with sacred and secular concerts, the procession of the festival's participants and the "war of songs" – all these events brought great interest for Latvians.The song festival movement in Latvia started in 1864 in the central part of Vidzeme and later on in Kurzeme, but in 1873 the First General Latvian Song Festival took place in Riga. 45 choirs with 1019 participants from all the regions of Latvia took part in it. It was the first most significant manifestation of Latvian nation's self-awareness. As N. Strunke's poster shows it, then in 1933 the 8th Latvian Song festival took place. The historical situation had changed: in the Republic of Latvia founded in 1918 Latvians had become the full-fledged and self-dependent masters of their own lives in their own land. The traditions of chorus singing remained and as before the participants of the Latvian song festival being dressed in national costumes of each region came to Riga in June. Spectators were always surprised by the difference in age of people participating in these festivals – there were various generations, incuding the elderly and school-children.N. Strunke has emphasized the tradition of song festival by depicting a sage with a zither (an ancient music instrument) in his hands. The old man is surrounded by singing children and a young woman. The artist prefers sketchily drawn ornaments of the national costumes. The attractiviness of the event is accentuated by the fluttering hair; the score lines witness on the musical character of this event and they separate the visual part of the work from that of the textual. The atmosphere of the festival is emphasized by the bright colours used in the poster. The tradition of song festival has allowed to maintain people's national self-awareness during the long years of Soviet occupation and it continues to exist nowadays.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The author of the poster 'Latvijas precu izstade = Utstallning av Lettiska varor 1934' is the Latvian graphic artist OskarsŠteinbergs (1882-1937), who has mainly worked in advertising. This poster brings to light the propaganda activities, that started already on the threshold of the 20-ties and 30-ties and concerned Latvian goods production.For this exhibition in Stockholm, O. Šteinbergs has chosen images that are typical for both countries and are easy recognizable for the general public. The new state Latvia, pointed out by a red ribbon in the colours of its flag, declares itself in Sweden, which is symbolized bythe decorated prow of Vikings long ship in the foreground of this work. The fine horizontal line as if marks the geographical location of the remote overseas state, but the gleam of red-white-red ribbon in the water as if showes the way that is connecting both of these lands. The depiction of the starlit night is intentional for it is the most favourite day-time for the Vikings voyages. O.Šteinbergs has successfully included some text in the composition of the poster. It is thought, that graphic form of the letters has been created under the influence of Swedish advertising art. Thus the playful letters correspond well to the romantic atmosphere of this work. Even the use of the logo Ost created by the artist himself is well considered and, like the depiction of stars, it serves the decorative purposes. The images chosen in the work are subjected to Art Deco geometric stylization, but the general atmosphere of the poster brings the reminescences of Art Nouveau – the style characteristic for the time, when O.Šteinbergs began his creative work in art.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The author of the 'Baltijas makslinieku gleznu izstade' ('Baltic artists' painting exhibition') is a Baltic-German artist Bernhard Borchert (1863-1945) who the greatest part of his life has spent in Latvia. He has worked in the field of painting and has produced book and magazine illustrations. At the beginning of the 20th century the territory of Latvia was a part of Russia's empire and by the Baltic region was understood Estonia, Vidzeme and Kurzeme provinces. Riga at this time was not only the economic and the industrial centre of these provinces, but also the cultural centre. This poster is devoted to a very significant event in its life of art. On 3 September, 1905 by opening the Baltic artists' painting exhibition the new City Art museum was opened. This was the first specially built building in Riga for the functions of a museum (architect Wilhelm Neumann). The architectonics and the interior of this building are very significant examples of the style characteristic for the beginning of the 20th century. At present the State Art Museum is situated there and it is the main depositary of Latvian art.The poster is made in rather cold and reserved colours and in clearly separated colour planes. For the general public of the beginning of the 20th century B. Borchert has chosen easy understandable images - a teenager, laurel and generalized silhouettes of the national emblems. The boy symbolizes the new culture – in this case - the modern art, but the depiction of the three coats of arms on the laurel symbolize the art heritage of the three Baltic provinces. The subtle decorativeness of Art Nouveau in the poster as if merges with the spirit of mystery so characteristic to symbolism, and it is created by accentuation of the shadow of the teenager's figure. Another feature of Art Nouveau is the atectonic composition where the artist has successfully included the information on this event in 3 different languages. The poster represents the German school to which B. Borchert's talent has added the reservedness so characteristic to the mentality of Baltics.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Josef Gabriel Rheinberger (1839-1901), was a composer and composition teacher. He received his first lessons in music at the age of five, played the organ two years later in his home town and in 1851, at the age of 12 years, he started his studies at the Music School in Munich which he successfully completed in 1854. In 1859, he obtained a position as a piano teacher at this institute and as a composition teacher a year later. In 1867, he married Franziska von Hoffnass, a widow eight years his senior and his affectionate wife until her death in 1892. At the reorganised Royal Music School, he obtained a lectureship in organ playing and composition and was appointed inspector (=director) of the composition and instrumental classes in 1871. From 1877 onwards, he also conducted the Royal Court Orchestra after relinquishing his post at the head of the Oratorio Association (which he had held since 1864). His reputation as a music teacher steadily grew. He instructed about 600 pupils, among them Engelbert Humperdinck, Wilhelm Kienzl, Ludwig Thuille, Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari and Wilhelm Furtwängler.As a composer, he published 197 works with an opus number and numerous works without an opus number. These are of a Classic-Romantic style but certainly have an individual character of their own. They include masses, requiems, oratorios, sacral compositions for choirs, operas, secular choir works, solo songs , symphonies, chamber music, piano compositions and organ music, including in particular 20 great organ sonatas, an area in which he was a pioneer. He received numerous honours, including an honorary doctorate from the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Munich. His grave (together with that of his wife) is in the graveyard of Vaduz to where his remains were moved in 1949 following the destruction of his original grave in Munich's Südfriedhof cemetery by bombs in 1944.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>'Clavis Coeli', a collection of mass music, is an 18th-century manuscriptal hymn book written in Grodna (Lith. Gardinas) in 1760. It includes masses with invariable parts Kyrie, Gloria , Credo, Sanctus and Agnus Dei as well as separate hymns from ordinarium missae. Although there is a reference in this book that it is intended for hymn singing with organ, neither separate organ setters nor figured bass are provided. The majority of music has been written for one voice but there are masses for two or three voices too. They are written in mensural notation, but some of them have notations similar to modern with references indicating dynamics, tempo and metre in accordance with eight ecclesiastical modes and in some cases the tonality as well. Their traditional provenance is evident from geographical locations cited in titles such as: Missa Nazarethana in Terra Sancta, Missa Cracoviensis, Missa Grodnensis, etc. There is Vilnius Mass for one voice - Missa Seguitur Vilnensis Solemnis ex G minori, in which Credo part Et incarnatus up to Et ressurexit is written for three voices.The hymnal is a valuable relic of European ecclesiastical music of the mid 18th century, especially significant for Lithuania as it was written in Grodna, famous Lithuanian historical city and was performed in Vilnius' Bernardines Church. Those masses and hymns spread over the space of Roman Catholic ritual music of those times, proves that religious music of wide geographical range sounded in Lithuanian churches andmonasteries. In 1729 Lithuanian Bernardines finally established the Province of St.Casimir which later controlled the Grodna convent. It is highly credible that some parts of this collection were created by unknown Lithuanian Franciscans.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>A work in Latin by Lithuanian historian, the rector of Vilnius Academy, Albert Kojalowicz Wijuk (Lith. Albertas Kojalavièius Vijûkas, 1609-1677), whose first part was printed in Danzig in 1650 and the second in Antwerp in 1669. This was the first Lithuanian history written by a Lithuanian author and published as a separate edition. The author used works by the prominent 16th-century Polish chroniclers Alexander Guagnini and Matthew Stryjkowski as the sources to his history. The Renaissance society was yearning for knowledge not only about the New World but also of closer countries with whom relations were constantly increasing. The appearance of "History of Lithuania" was closely connected with Vilnius Academy, where Kojalowicz was a professor and his work was intended for students of this school.The considerable part of work by Kojalowicz belongs to fiction. The author was aiming to create historical writings in classical Latin. The writer deviated from the history of his native land only in those cases when he tried to explain its relations with foreign countries. Although this work, in which the outlook on the world is expressed by literary imagination, could not be compared with the rationalism prevailing in the historiography of Western Europe, none the less "History of Lithuania" by Kojalowicz successfully represented Lithuania in the scholastic world. The Renaissance in "History of Lithuania" is reminded only by the classical Latin language and some literary forms. Therefore the honour of the last Renaissance representative in Lithuania fell on Albert Kojalowizc. The ornate title page of the first volume reflects the best traditions of Danzig as an important printing centre of Eastern Europe.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>In this document, the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund Augustus grants the nobility, landowners and dukes of Orthodox belief, resident in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, equal rights with Catholics to occupy state service positions, to obtain land and to participate in state administration. The privilege is an evidence of one of the most striking and significant features of political and cultural life in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania - the religious and ethnic tolerance. Sigismund Augustus (1520-1572) was the King of Poland from 1548 (crowned in 1530) and the Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1529. The language of the document - Office Slavic - is unique also. This language in addition to the Latin and later the Polish languages was one of the state languages of the Grand Duchy, and as the official language of the Lithuanian chancellery, its usage was legalised by the Lithuanian Statute. The records on the back of this document are in Polish. The manuscript is finely decorated: the initial 'A' (21 lines, 25 cm) and an illumination on the top margin are adorned with floral vignettes (Indian ink, gilt bronze), and the capital letters of the text are gilded.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The series of etchings "Fatales consecuencias de la sangrienta guerra en España con Bonaparte y otros Caprichos enfáticos en 85 estampas. Inventadas, dibujadas y grabadas por el pintor original D. Francisco de Goya y Lucientes. En Madrid" was created by the famous Spanish artist Francisco de Goya y Lucientes (1746-1828) in the years 1808-1813. It was suggested by the struggle of the Spanish nation against Napoleon's army, which invaded Spain between 1808 and 1813. On his departure from Spain the artist left the etching plates in his son's custody. They remained in sealedboxes until 1854, unknown to the public. Later on they became the property of Goya's grandson and were subsequently sold to a private collection. In the autumn of 1862 they were bought by the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando) in Madrid.Thirty-five years after Goya's death, the Academy of San Fernando published the first printing of this series. The publication contained 80 etchings. They got a new numbering and authentic authorial comments were provided. The series title had been shortened and publication was named "Los Desastres de la Guerra" ("The Disasters of War"). By the settled tradition the series of 80 etchings was reprinted 6 times under the same title in 1892, 1902, 1906, 1923, 1930, 1937. The 8th printing in 1957-1958 was enlarged by adding five newly-found etchings, the title of the series did not change. The Art Department of the Library possesses the first edition of this etching series printed from the original plates. The publication was acquired from the famous Lithuanian painter and art collector Liudas Truikys (1904-1987) in 1946.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The collection of sermons by the rector of Vilnius' Jesuit college Jakób Wujek, translated from Polish by a Roman Catholic priest Mikalojus Daukša, is one of the most important 16th-century Lithuanian books which had a great influence on the development of the Lithuanian language and its consolidation in the public life of the state. The preface of the 'Postil' is a kind of patriotic manifesto urging inhabitants of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to maintain and foster their native language. For the first time in Lithuanian history Mikalojus Daukša laid out a comprehensive programme of state and society relations with the Lithuanian language.The Lithuanian language is an object of interest for comparative linguistics as it distinguishes from other Indo-European languages by having retained its archaic forms. For this reason nowadays Daukša's 'Postil' is a linguistic relic of exceptional importance. A photocopied edition of this book was produced in 1926. Out of six presently known original copies of this book five are held in Lithuania and the remaining one at the Vatican Library. In 1999 the 400th anniversary of this book will be commemorated at the state level. The new facsimile version of the 'Postil' will be published on that occasion. Such is the appraisal of the book for its significance in Lithuanian cultural history andthe world of linguistics. Among the holdings in the collection of Lithuanian Publications of the National Library the 'Postil' is the oldest 16th-century Lithuanian book.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This map of the town and fortress of Luxembourg, the second of its kind, was drawn in situ around 1560 by Jacob Roelofs, aka Jacob van Deventer, after the town of his birth. Called 'the geographer of the King of Spain', Jacob van Deventer was commissioned in 1558 to draw a series of maps of the main towns of the Netherlands (of which Luxembourg was a province in those days), which were to be included or copied subsequently into various publications. The map of Luxembourg drawn by Deventer served as a model for Franz Hogenberg, who is thought to have added most of the delightful details such as the trees, the houses, the well-dressed couple, as well as the arms of Philip II, the King of Spain and Duke of Luxembourg, and those of the town of Luxembourg proper.Hogenberg's reworking of the original was included into Georg Braun's encyclopedic 'Civitates orbis terrarum', published in Cologne in six volumes from 1572-1618, where it appears in vol. 3 ('Urbium praecipuarum totius mundi liber tertius') as nr 16. Although the printed privilege for this book is dated July 24 1576, the preface is dated 1581, which therefore can be considered to be the real date of publication. The map was repeatedly taken over into other publications, and one finds it with only very slight alterations e.g. in Lodovico Guicciardini's 'Descrittione di tutti i Paesi Bassi, altrimenti detti Germania inferiore', first published in Antwerp in 1581, and widely circulated all over Europe due to its translations into French, German, Dutch and Latin. It was also reprinted in Joannes Blaeu's 'Novum ac magnum theatrum urbium Belgicae regiae' (Amsterdam, 1649), and it was only during the second half of the 17th century that the map's popularity gradually began to decline.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This manuscript was produced for the Abbey of St. Antoine de Viennois in Dauphiné, France, where, according to an ancient tradition, the relics of St. Anthony the Abbot, the hermit saint of Egypt, were preserved. The only other extant duplicate of this work is found among the manuscripts collected by the Medicis and preserved at the Biblioteca Laurenziana in Florence (Ms. Laur. Med. Pal. 143). From the colophon at the end of the Malta manuscript, we learn that the pictures were copied from a large linen cloth which was hung in the Church of St. Anthony on his feast-day (January 17) and other festivals and on which were depicted the life and acts of the saint. It states that the illustrations in the manuscript were painted by Master Robin Fournier of Avignon and the Latin text was compiled by Jean Macellard and written by Pierre Pierre of Istres, Provence. The manuscript was completed on April 14th, 1426 and donated to the monastery by the Prior, Guigue Robert de Tullins, who had ordered the book to be painted and written, on condition that it never be taken out of the church.The manuscript, which measures 400 mm by 280 mm, originally consisted of 102 leaves or 204 pages and comprised 200 paintings, four of which later went missing, on parchment leaves. The pictures were painted in semi-grisaille with emerald green and vermilion. The last picture of the series represents St. Anthony with the kneeling donor, Prior Guigue Robert. Under each picture is a short Latin description and the source is usually given, although the scribe of the Malta manuscript, Pierre Pierre, left out a few of the references unlike the scribe of the Florence manuscript who inserted all of them. Following the suppression of the Order of St. Antoine de Viennois in 1775 and its merging with the Order of the Knights Hospitaller of St. John which at the time ruled the Maltese Islands, the manuscript, together with several other items, travelled to Malta in 1781. It was deposited among the holdings of the then Bibliotheca Publica and is today considered to be one of the most treasured possessions of the National Library of Malta.</dc:description>

		<dc:title>2008 - Cantemir's year in Moldova</dc:title>
		<dc:creator>Unknown,</dc:creator>
		<dc:subject>politics</dc:subject>
		<dc:description>Cantemir, Dimitrie (1673-1723) comes from a family of Moldovan boyars with a politic role in the history of Moldova. The son of Moldavian Voevode Constantin Cantemir, was twice Prince of Moldavia (in March-April 1693 and in 1710-1711). Being a child he was sent as a hostage to Constantinopol between 1683-1691. He studies at the Patriarchate’s school from Constantinopol, where he learns Greek, Latin, Turkish, Persian, Arabic, Geography, Literature, Metaphysics, Logics, Ethics and Mohammedan religion. Hoping to liberate the country under the Ottoman Empire domination, he concludes a secret treaty of alliance with Peter I, the Tsar of Russia. After the defeat of russo-moldavian army in Russo-Turkish War (1711) at Stanilesti, Dimitrie Cantemir sought refuge in Russia, where he became a counselor of Peter I and developed a productive scientific activity. In 1713 he marries to one of Prince Trubetskoy’s daughters, got sick during the expedition of the Russian army in Persia and on the way back he died. His remains were carried to Iasi, at the Church Three Hierarchs.A person of encyclopedic culture, he was chosen in 1714 a member of the Royal Academy of Berlin, one of the famous scientists of the century, a remarkable historian, geographer and orientalist. His work was influenced by the humanism of the Renaissance and contains philosophical, literary and historic writings. “Descriptio Moldaviae” (“Description of Moldova”), a descriptive-geographic work, considered valuable as a historic source, is translated from Latin in German and published at Hamburg in the journal “Magazin für die neue Historie und Geographie, vol. III-IV” (1769-1770). The second edition of this work in German appears at Frankfurt-Leipzic (1771), and includes a map of Moldova (printed in 1837 at Hague, unique cartographic document in the course of a century about Moldova), then translated in Russian (1789) and many times in Romanian (1825, reprinted in 1851 and 1865, 1909, 1923 et al.). “Incrementa atque decrementa aulae othomanicae” (“History of the Ottoman Empire”) translated in English (1734-1735), French (1743) and German (1745), is a work that relates the history of Turkey. Among Cantemir’s principal works are: “Historia Hieroglyphica” (a social novel where the scientific satire is combined with the humoristic usage of the erudition); “The Divan or the Wise Man’s Parley with the World…” (a medieval theme of the dispute between body and soul); “Compendiolum universae logices institutions” (a manual of Logics); “Chronicle of the durability of Romans-Moldavians-Wallachians”; “The System of the Mohammedan Religion”; “Sacrosanctae scientiae indepingibilis imago” (“The Image of the Sacred Undepictable Science”) et al. He also wrote in Turkish a treaty of the theory of Turkish music and is the author of some vocal and instrumental creations in the style of oriental music.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The spreading in Europe of the work “History of the Ottoman Empire”, that was for many years the foundation of investigations and the main source of information about Turkish history, is due to Cantemir’s son, Antioh Cantemir, a poet and diplomat. Being an Ambassador of Russia in London and Paris, he directly contributed to the translation of the manuscript from Latin in the English and French Languages (The history of the growth and decay of Othoman Empire / translated into English by N. Tindal (1687-1774). – London, 1734-1735; Histoire de l’empire Othoman , ou se voyent les causes de son agrandissement et de sa decadence / trad. M. de Jonquières. Paris, 1743).The translation in German from English by Schmidt appears in 1745 at Hamburg, imprinted in the printing-house of Christian Herold. History of the Ottoman Empire represents an editorial work on a large scale (1916 p.), enclosed with a List of the portraits of Turkish sultans and a topographic plan in detail of Constantinopol, in the right corner is placed the drawing of the “Palace of Prince Demetrius Cantemir”, a register of foreign words and a series of interesting introductive materials. At the end of the volume is included Dimitrie Cantemir’s biography, composed by his son Antioh because of the printing of the first London edition. The copy is in a very good condition: the cover from pressboard is wrapped with parchment, the portrait of Dimitrie Cantemir and the familial blazon engraved by C. Fritysch in original, those 22 copies of the portraits of the ottoman sultans, the topographic plan and the entire gallery of engravings, vignettes, initial and final letters engraved by C. A. Wagner, G. D. Heuman and M. Tyroff. The extensive notices and comments, that contain information about Turkish historic and contemporary persons, their biographies, institutions, schools, monuments, personal memories et al. are valuable information, and cannot be replaced with any historic source until present days.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>A distinctive feature of brocade paper is an embossed structure pressed into the paper by means of real or imitation gold or silver foil. Thick plates or cylinders of copper were used, with the representation in positive or negative relief. In most cases uncoloured paper was used, but sometimes coloured paper or paper with a coloured design was used as the basis for such decorated paper. Later on brocade paper was sometimes coloured by hand. It comes in all variations, from simple patterns to very intricate ones, while often the names and residences of the maker and the designer are found in the margin, together with its serial number.The first brocade papers were made in Augsburg around 1700. They belong to the most valuable and vulnerable decorated papers. These papers are very sensitive and liable to deterioration from humidity and air pollution and require high storage standards, also for the prevention of user-damage. The paper-historical collection has a large number of brocade papers, including various magnificent applications of such papers as part of bookbindings, for instance as covers of nineteenth-century doctoral theses.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The artist Jean Fouquet, who was active in Tours between 1450 and 1480, is considered the greatest French painter of the fifteenth century. He made several panel paintings, while ten manuscripts are known of which he executed the decoration either in full or, in most cases, only in part. Thus he supplied only six miniatures (on either side of three leaves) for the small 'Book of Hours', of which two parts are now in the Koninklijke Bibliotheek and one in the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu.The representation of the Madonna with the Christ child is considered one of the undisputed masterpieces of the painter's oeuvre. It has an unparalleled atmosphere of tenderness and intimacy, evoked by the overhanging veil of the Virgin Mary, also partly covering the child's head. Equally noteworthy is the way in which the child puts his little hand on the edge of the columbine-decorated border, a trompe-l'oeil which creates the illusion of space between figures and border. The Getty part contains two miniatures in which the patron, Simon de Varie, a finance official under the French Kings Charles VII and Louis XI, is depicted kneeling before the enthroned Virgin and child.The decoration of the actual 'Book of Hours', consisting of no fewer than 80 miniatures with decorated borders, was executed by two Paris artists, Master François and the Master of the Dunois Book of Hours. These artists were specialised in 'little white books', small-scale Books of Hours with white as their predominant colour. The 'Book of Hours of Simon de Varie' also belongs to this group, as can be seen from the page opposite the representation of the Virgin Mary. In the garments of Christ walking upon the sea and of the three apostles in the miniature, as well as in the foliage of the border decoration, white is the dominating colour.The 'Book of Hours' was divided into three parts by a seventeenth-century owner, Philippe de Béthune. One part entered the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in 1816 as part of the collections of the stadholders; the second part, with the portrait of the Virgin, was bought in 1890 from the Frankfurt antiquarian bookseller J. Baer. The third part surfaced in California in 1985 and was purchased by the J. Paul Getty Museum.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Jan Huygen van Linschoten (1563-1611) left the Netherlands for Spain in December 1593 to continue his training as a merchant. The commercial ambitions of this adventurous son of a public notary in Haarlem reached, however, much further than the borders of the Iberian peninsula. While pursuing his fortune he gained the confidence of the Archbishop of Goa, which made him the first Dutchman to get an impression of the gigantic colonial empire built by Portugal in the Far East. On his return to the Netherlands Van Linschoten sold the story of his travels to the Amsterdam publisher Cornelis Claesz, who published it in 1596 in a book elaborately illustrated with maps and prints. The Itinerario is not only a travel story: apart from the tale of Van Linschoten's wanderings on the Azores, in Portugal, and the present Indonesia two of his other works have been included, both dealing with navigation: 'the Beschryvinghe van de gantsche custe van Guinea' and the 'Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten'.The significance of this first Dutch survey of the former Netherlands East Indies lies in the valuable sailing instructions which Van Linschoten had managed to acquire, information that could only be found in the secret archives of the Portuguese administration. Abusing the trust put in him he had copied it page by page. Thus, in one step, the greatly coveted shipping route to the Netherlands East Indies and the route between the Asiatic sea ports as such, came within reach for Dutch navigators. Even more crucially, Van Linschoten had also obtained information on very delicate nautical data that provided insight into the currents, deeps, islands and sandbanks, and such knowledge was absolutely vital for safe navigation. Additionally, everything was elucidated by coastal depictions and maps of unprecedented accuracy for those days.Dutch pilots had been preparing for the long voyage to the Far East for quite some time by research, study and practice. Since 1580 several foreign manuals, in which the technique of navigating the oceans was explained in full detail, had been translated into Dutch. Cartographic horizons had also been broadened. Within a period of scarcely ten years the nautical scope of Dutch navigators was improved almost to perfection and extended to the Mediterranean and the whole area between the Canaries and Russia. The publication of the 'Itinerario' in 1596 added the missing link to the research into itineraries and trade routes to the Indonesian Archipelago. A vast overseas trading empire was the immediate result.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Description of the bookbinding: brown calf, gold-tooled, painted in white, black, grey, and dark green, with traces of red. Both covers have a rich interlace pattern with moresques. On the front cover a dedication to the Emperor. The round panel in the centre must have originally shown the painted coat of arms of Charles V. Christopher Plantin, the world-famous printer and publisher, was born c. 1520 in France and died in Antwerp in 1589. He started his career as a bookbinder and achieved great professional renown. He had learned the craft in Caen and left with his wife and child for Paris in 1547 to reach trueperfection. In 1549 they moved to Antwerp, where Plantin was granted civil rights in 1550 and started a bookbinding business. He did not start printing until 1555, when an accident put a permanent end to his bookbinding activities.Like his colleagues Plantin never signed his bookbindings. In the past a number of bindings have been attributed to him, but not corroborated by documentary evidence. The binding reproduced here has served as an important link in Plantin research, because an Antwerp prognostication from 1544 was found under the pastedown, thus establishing at any rate that it was made in Antwerp. Only in 1966 could Colin and Nixon attribute one binding definitely to Plantin, because of an entry he had written. The authors at the same time presented a list of 42 bindings attributed to the master, including this one, because of the same tools. The binding was a present from the translator of the book, Willem van Male, or the publisher, Joannes Steelsius, to Charles V. Both maintained good relations with the Emperor and it was in their own interests to present him with this book about his acts of war in a splendid bindingà la mode. Another copy of the same book has an almost identical binding. It was made for Charles's son Philip II, and has his coat of arms on the front cover.The binding in the Koninklijke Bibliotheek must originally have had Charles's coat of arms painted in the centre panel, which is now empty. The decoration of the binding is closest to the best Paris bindings from the 1540-1560 period. The pattern of interlaces and moresques did not originate in France, but came via Italy from the world ofIslam. The Renaissance binders had no classical examples to fall back on, but found their inspiration in Islamic art, which also inspired the use of a new cover material, morocco, and gold-tooling.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This sketch by Rembrandt, depicting with only a few swift brush strokes the moment when old Simeon takes the Infant Jesus in his arms in the temple of Jerusalem, is one of the many illustrations in that most splendid and precious album of the seventeenth century that belonged to Jacobus Heyblocq. Although he started his album in the last year of his theological studies in Leiden, it has turned out to be anything but a student's album. In the opening poem he states his aim of wanting to acquire contributions by the famous people of his time, whom he enticed to contribute by suggesting that, if one day they were no longer with us, their contributions to his album would at any rate keep their memories alive for posterity. In hindsight this poem was not really necessary, for in the course of years Heyblocq made the acquaintance of so many famous contemporaries, that there are hardly any traces of autograph hunting in his album.No other Dutch album can boast such an impressive array of men of letters, visual artists, scholars and scientists. Among the contributions by poets and playwrights such as Cats, Huygens, Dullaert, Asselijn, Anslo, Vos, Focquenbroch, Westerbaen and Revius, the rarely represented Joost van den Vondel takes pride of place. He makes a pun on Heyblocq's name, while referring to the swampy ground on which Amsterdam is built: 'IAKOB, if eternal fame is thy desire, To build a house or church do not aspire On swampy soil, the bogs of courting favour: For soils like that are bound to sag and waver; Despite unstinting use of HEIBLOCK (rammer) and of pile. Bogs constitute a threat, for they beguile [...]' Even more spectacular than the many poems in this album are the contributions by visual artists such as Rembrandt. Another striking example is the pen and ink drawing by Aert van der Neer, showing the Amsterdam people living on Geldersekade enjoying themselves with the pleasurable pastimes of winter: skating and the game of pall-mall.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Edvard Grieg composed his Piano Concerto in a minor opus 16 during the summer of 1868 when he stayed at Søllerød outside Copenhagen. The concerto was dedicated to his friend, the pianist Edmund Neupert who was also the soloist when it was first performed in Copenhagen’s Tivoli in April 1869. Since then the concerto has been a favourite of audiences as well as of pianists all over the world, even if the critics have always been divided with regard to the artistic value of the concerto. The only preserved, autographed manuscript of the concerto is now in the National Music Collection of the National Library of Norway. This manuscript was used for printing the first edition which was eventually published by the Leipzig music publisher Fritzsch in 1872.The original manuscript had been used for a number of concerts following the first performance in Copenhagen. It bears clear traces of corrections and changes to the orchestration right up til the time when the first printed edition appeared. During his lifetime Grieg continued to revise the score, and three revised editions were published (1882(?), 1890 and 1895 - the last two by Edition Peters) until his death in September 1907, some of these were substantial changes. There are two striking differences in the autograph score and the first edition if you compare them to the version that is performed today, these are the opening of the first movement and the scoring of the first occurence of the secondary theme in the same movement.

		<dc:description>Beside the composer Edvard Grieg, the Norwegian soprano Kirsten Flagstad (1895-1962) is probably Norway’s internationally best known artist within the field of classical music. After her début at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York in 1935 as Sieglinde in Wagner’s “Die Walküre”, she became world famous. Flagstad held concerts and had many roles in operas around the world, i.e. in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Copenhagen, Paris, London, New York, Bayreuth, Brussels, Vienna, Prague, Cannes, Milan, Boston, Chicago, Honolulu, Australia, Central America and of course in Norway. After her official retirement in 1953 she held many charity concerts and farewell concerts in the USA and Europe. In 1958 she was appointed the first director of the Norwegian National Opera.Today the</dc:description>

The museum is situated in her birth-town Hamar, in the very same house in which she was born. The recording from the Paris concert and the picture material are made available in co-operation with the Kirsten Flagstad Museum. The song has also been recorded in English, German and French by other performers. The National Library of Norway presents this sound excerpt since this is a part of a collection of historic recordings of Kirsten Flagstad that has been digitized at the National Library.

		<dc:description>During the years 1274 -1276 the code of King Magnus the Lawmender was enacted throughout the Norwegian legislative assemblies, thus giving Norway a common code of laws which applied to the country as a whole. In Europe, Iceland is the only other country where a common legal code has been in force for such a long period of time. The men of the law and the most important civil servants possessed hand written copies of the code wherein amendments and regulations were gradually incorporated. Several of these old Norwegian law books have been preserved. The National Library owns a parchment copy from the 14th century, which includes supplements written on paper until 1560. The book was bound in 1562 in a tooled, tanned leather cover over wooden boards, blind stamped and with brass clasps. The manuscript is a good illustration of the Norwegian written culture during the period from the High Middle Ages until the Reformation.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>An autograph for an edition of the cycle of 24 preludes for grand piano from 1831-1839, completed at the Majorca, having the most interesting provenance of the 21 Chopin manuscripts held by the National Library. The copy, featuring the characteristic traits of style of the composer’s hand, the delicacy and the same time the confidence of his hand-writing, contains also notes for the publisher and the engraver and the dedication reading: "a son ami J. C. Kessler". The first publisher of the cycle according to the manuscript was Adolph Catelin based in Paris (June 1839), which is confirmed by the marks of the publishing company added at the bottom of the first page. The autograph, originally a set of hand-ruled leaves of a rough copy, featuring page numbering by F.Chopin was made into one volume around 1943 and artistically bound in embossed leather by Bonawentura Lenart.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>"La Sforziada" is a historical-panygyrical work about the founder of the ducal dynasty of Milan, Francisco Sforza (1401-1475). In the 15th century the Milan-based publishing house of Antonio Zarotto pressed three editions of this text in the years 1482, 1486 and 1490. Only few copies of the 1490 impression were printed on vellum for the members of the ducal family. They were, each on an individual basis, decorated by illuminations by Giovanni Pietro Birago, an outstanding miniaturist who worked for the Milan court. Each miniature, in spite of the common scheme, constitutes an integral, selfstanding work featuring symbolics full of court-related and political hints, enabling identification of the ducal addresses of the four copies known to exist.The copy of duke Lodovico il Moro is held at the British Library. The copy of duke Gian Galeazza Sforza, father of Queen Bona, is held at the Bibliotheque Nationale de France. A heavily damaged copy from the court library of the Sforza family of Pavia has been recently found at the Ufizzi Gallery in Florence. At the National Library in Warsaw is held a volume, which until recently was assigned to the descendants of duke Gian Galeazzo and Isabelle of Aragon and which could belong only to Queen Bona. The most recent research has indicated an addresse among the descendants of duke Gian Galeazzo Sanseverino, the son-in-law of Lodovico il Moro. Only this copy is signed by the author of miniatures, Giovanni Pietro Birago. It comes from the collections of the Zamoyski Library, earlier it was probably the property of king Sigismund Augustus and after his death, of chancellor Jan Zamoyski. F.7., illuminated : in the base of the right margin is a vase, in its border-strip is the sign : P[re]SB[yte]R IO[annes] PETR[us] BIRAGUS FE[cit]”. In the initial space of the text is the portrait of Francesco Sforza.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Bartolomeo Francesco Rastrelli (1700-1771), a Russian architect of Italian descent, son of a sculptor B.C. Rastrelli (1675-1744). After the studies in Italy (1725-1730) a court architect of the empresses Anne and Elisabeth. A leading figure of Russian baroque. A turning point in Rastrelli’s career was his design for the duke of Kurland, count John Ernest Biron (1690-1772) of a unique palace and garden in Ruental and Mitawa. Undoubtedly the most interesting of the six drawings concerning the palace in Mitawa is the variant of the general plan of 1753 and the view of the façade from the side of the river produced towards the end of the 1730s.Rastrelli’s buildings in Kurland belong to an early period of the artist’s work. They were the first to reveal his artistic ideas and composition and town planning concepts which the artist developed in his later, already mature works. Rastrelli’s designs are distinct through their high scale and the inexhaustible richness of rhythms of compositions made up of solids and plastic forms. The main means of expression is the immense order enriching the plastic features of the walls and enhancing their dynamism. Rastrelli often said that he followed the example of contemporary Italian architecture. However, while comparing his buildings with the works of Italian or German baroque, we observe the uniqueness of his concepts.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The work of ancient Greek culture 'Geografice hyfegesis ...' by Claudius Ptolemy, an astronomer and geographer of Alexandria was written around 160A.C. It influences the knowledge of the world and the self-awareness of Europeans for nearly 1500 years. The text in the presented BOZ codex (Zamoyski Library) is the fourth edited version of Geography authored by a monk Donnus Nicolaus Germanus with the later added title Cosmographia Claudii Ptolemaei. It contains, in the first volume the text of the work dedicated to pope Paul II and in the second volume 27 maps prepared on the basis of information contained in the work by Ptolemy and three "new" maps drawn according to the state of knowlegde from the beginning of the 15th century. One may find in it very significant information about Europe and the whole ancient world from the times before the discovery of America.It is the only preserved copy of the fourth edited version, which is why it is of immense interest to historians. It has not been published thus far, only pre-war facsimiles of two maps quotes in several publications are known. The whole codex is very richly decorated and gilt-edged. Both maps and their descriptions are within frames featuring floral motifs, at the beginning of each description are gilt initials in the bianchi ghirari style. The presented map of the world, stretching from Western Ocean to China and from the sources of Nile to Greenland is at the same time image of the Earth in the boundless outer space. It is surrounded by personifications of 12 winds, the luminous oval in gold, pinkish and blue symbolizes the elements which make up the Universe: earth, air, fire and water. The other hemisphere was not presented. The record is available in:</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The Sacramentarium is the oldest part of the holy mass i.e. prayers said during the mass by the priest (Collect, Preface, Secret, Canon, post Communion Prayer). The 'Tyniec Sacramentarium' was written in ca. 1060-1070 in the Cologne diocese. It is one of the few surviving codices in Poland, brought to Poland and offered to the abbey at Tyniec. Magnificently decorated, it is one of the most precious artefacts of the Ottonian painting school comparable with the Freiburg Sacramentarium and the Abdinghof Book of Gospels. It contains 38 pages written in gold and silver letters on purple-tinted parchment, two figurative miniatures, and two full-page plaited initials, an interesting liturgical calendar, and the oldest musical notation in Poland in chironomic form. The sumptuous form Sacramentarium indicates that the codex belonged to the so-called royal manuscripts, which not only performed a liturgical function, but also reflected the monarchy’s splendour.One of the oldest manuscripts known to exist in Poland, it was used until at least the 13th century. It was stolen during the Swedish invasion in the 17th century. Repurchased in Cracow, it returned to Tyniec, probably without the original binding. The brown leather binding in which this tome has survived was made in the 17th century at the Tyniec abbey. On the front and back part of the cover is an oval ex libris tooled in gold, along with the crest of the abbey and the inscription: “DIVI TUTELLARES COENOBI TYNECENSIS”. In 1814 it was bought by Stanislaw Kostka Zamoyski and included in the Library the Zamoyski Estate Library. During the World War II the Nazis tried to take the manuscript to Berlin, but thanks to the endeavours of librarians, scholars and diplomats, they left it in the Zamoyski Library. After the Warsaw Uprising the manuscript was secretly evacuated and hidden in a collegiate church in Lowicz, where it survived until the end of the War. In 1946 it found its way to the National Library together with all the deposits of the Library of the Zamoyski Estate.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The 'Origem da Lingoa Portuguesa' (Origins of the Portuguese Language), by Duarte Nunes de Leão (c. 1630-1608), was published exactly four centuries ago, in 1606. It is, however, a slightly older book: according to its printing permissions, it was probably written during 1600 and ready for publication as soon as 1601.Duarte Nunes de Leão was a magistrate of high standing at the Portuguese court. He is best known, however, for his historical and linguistic books, namely for an Orthographia da Lingoa Portuguesa (Orthography of the Portuguese Language), the first ever published in Portugal. The Origem is an essay on the changeability of languages, which Duarte Nunes accepts with unusual willingness for his times. Numerous and lengthy wordlists provide him with data for chapters on lexical borrowing from several languages, on diachronic strata, or on the obsolescence of some words. The work is crowned by the apology of the Portuguese language in comparison with others.This is mainly a book relevant for linguistic and grammatical historiography. Modern readers should tread carefully on its facts (e. g., from a list of 300 words allegedly imported from the French, only 60 deserve that imputation), but it is precisely its blending of phantasy and experience that turns the Origem into a good example of Renaissance scholarship.The full book can be seen at:</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Integrated in the Italian mannerist spirit, this drawing is one of the rare decoration projects of the end of the sixteenth century preserved in Portugal up to present times. It is the sumptuous decoration for the ceiling of the nave of Igreja do Hospital Real de Todos-os-Santos, in Lisbon, founded in 1492, by King D. João II and concluded by King D. Manuel, in 1503. This work, attributed to Fernão Gomes, did not survive the fire which destroyed the church in 1601. It was a wooden ceiling formed by fifteen paintings framed by guilded carvings, representing themes related to miraculous cures and hospitality, taken from the Old and New Testaments.Fernão Gomes (1548-1612), of Spanish origin, worked, between 1570 and 1572, in the Blocklandt workshop, in Delft. In Lisbon, from 1573 onwards, he did several works, having been appointed Royal Painter of King Filipe I in 1594 and, in 1602, he was appointed to the Table of the Saint Luke Brotherhood. In 1604, in association with Diogo Teixeira, Fernão Gomes worked again in the Hospital Real, doing the paintings of the roof of the main chapel of the Church. The Hospital Real de Todos-os-Santos was destroyed by another fire in 1750 and, after the 1755 Earthquake, was transferred to the building of the former Convent of S. Antão, nowadays the Hospital de S. José.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Ludolphus of Saxony, a Carthusian monk, born in Saxony, lived in the 14th century in Mainz, where he wrote, among others, the work through which he became known: 'Vita Christi', a story of the life of Christ, told in a suggestive manner which inspires in its readers sentiments of piety and devotion. Many editions were made, both in Latin and in other languages, the first having been published in Germany, in 1474. In Portugal, it was translated by Cistercian monks of the Alcobaça Abbey in the first half of the 15th century and printed in 1495, by order of Queen D. Leonor, wife of King D. João II. Ordered to Valentino of Moravia (Valentim Fernandes), a German printer recently arrived in Lisbon, associated with another German, Nicholas of Saxony, the 4th part came out of press on the 14th May 1495, followed by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd parts, respectively on the 14th August, 4th September and 20th of November of the same year, all of them also illustrated and printed in gothic characters, in black and red. It is nowadays considered a monument of Portuguese typography of the fourteenth century.The image shows the beginning of Livro Segundo, having on the left a xylograph representing the Calvary (copy of an engraving attributed to the German engraver Master E. S.) and, below, the Kings of Portugal, D. João II and D. Leonor, kneeling in adoration. The decoration , which surrounds the first page of the text is formed by horizontal borders with floral motifs and animals having, at the bottom, in the center, a white shield. The capital, also of German origin, has a decoration of leaves and flowers on a black background.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The 'Etymologiae' of S. Isidoro of Sevilha (circa 560-636) are formed by twenty books and were written towards the end of the author’s life upon request of S. Braulio. They appear as a true encyclopedia organized systematically. The author profusely used innumerable sources, which he often does not quote, attempting to cover all ancient knowledge and to transmit it to posterity. At present, around one thousand codices with the text of the 'Etymologiae' are known, which shows the extraordinary disclosure of this great encyclopedia during the Middle Ages, first in the Iberian Peninsula, then in France and from there throughout all Europe.This copy, dating from the thirteenth century, originating from the Cistercian monastery of Santa Maria de Alcobaça, is written in librarian caroline lettering; the initials have a sober leafy ornamentation; in what concerns decoration, besides that which is described elsewhere, the geometrical figures (Book III) and the diagrammatized representation of the Earth according to the T-O plan (Book XIV) should be mentioned. The codex also contains another work by S. Isidoro, De naturis rerum ad Sisebutum and letters from S. Bráulio to him. The folia reproduced herein show a crowned figure in a robe with rigid folds, holding a genealogical tree of geometrical forms containing the relationship names, and other genealogical tables set in architectural frames with full turn arches.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>As Armando Cortesão wrote: 'nothing is known about the primitive story of this Atlas'. Its authorship is attributable to Fernão Vaz Dourado, an opinion which is corroborated by all the historians who compared it with other similar works signed by this cartographer. With regards to the date of its creation, after a careful in-depth analysis of the matter, Armando Cortesão was able to conclude that it was drawn between 1575 and 1580, possibly in Lisbon circa 1576. The Atlas in question is formed by 20 folia, drawn on parchment support, measuring 380 x 510mm, folded in half and joined by a bookbinder’s tape glued to the reverse. Out of the 20 folia which form the Atlas, the first three contain cosmographic data, navigation regulations and quadrennial tables of solar declination, and the remaining seventeen are formed by nautical charts. The binding is in brown leather with gold engraved fastenings. The reproduced image represents the western coast of Europe, from the south of Scandinavia, along the western Mediterranean coasts, to the north of Africa, a little to the north of Cape of Good Hope, and it includes the Atlantic archipelagos.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The final manuscript of 'O Guardador de Rebanhos' by Fernando Pessoa - the greatest Portuguese poet of the 20th century - has a very special interest: it marks the moment when the 49 poems which form the cycle were for the first time organized in the order which definitely became its own. However, this time, Pessoamade a fair copy under the form of a manuscript, in several foolscap folia. Since he kept the manuscript in his hands for a long time, never having sent it to the printer, he was able to retouch the text of the poems now and then. Some pages show marks of successive text revisions, in different inks and handwriting which, besides being spectacular, have the particularity of not confirming the idea, made known by the poet, that these poems were written under the effect of sudden inspiration.This manuscript was owned by the scholar, and relative of the poet, Eduardo Freitas da Costa, having changed hands several times and having been in Brazil for some years. Finally, it belonged to the bookseller Telles da Silva but was not entirely unknown of the public, since it was object of a facsimile edition in 1986. The complete set was only published in 1946, in the volume of the Complete Works called 'Poemas de Alberto Caeiro'. However, twenty four of those poems had been published during the author’s lifetime. In 1925, in nr. 4 of the review Athena, and under the title of "Escolha de poemas de Alberto Caeiro: 1889-1915: de ‘O Guardador de Rebanhos’" and, in 1931, nr 30 of Presença includes 'O oitavo poema...'The image reproduces the first poem of the cycle - Eu nunca guardei rebanhos: [1st v.] -, written in the second page of the folio, in black ink and shows later amendments and additions. First in pencil, in the margin and/or between lines and later, also, in black ink used with two different writing instruments. The poem is dated, at the end (pg. 5), in red ink with the indication [8-3-1914], over which can be read [8-3-1913]. At the right of the numbering of the poem is a mark, in red pencil and, on the upper left corner, the reference “1889-1915”, which corresponds to the supposed dates of the birth and death of the heteronym Alberto Caeiro.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The first book printed on the present-day territory of Romania in 1508, during the reign of Radu the Great, by Macarie of Montenegro extraction. There are five copies in the country - three in the Library of the Romanian Academy, one in the Archbishopric Library in Sibiu and the one described here in the National Library. This copy is complete and has been restored. The binding is that of the time - brown leather on wood, a simple monastic work - similar in style and colour with the copies held in the Library of the Academy. It is considered that its provenance is, likewise, the Bistrita Monastery in Oltenia. It was compulsory for the Orthodox Church liturgy service books of that time to include the three liturgies: that according to St. John Chrisostomos, that of St. Basil the Great and the Divine Liturgy, preceded by the set ritual of the liturgy, comprising the service performend by the deacon. Macarie's Liturgy Service Book of 1508 presents an uncommon form of the Slavonic liturgy by including at the beginning 'St. Basil the Great's teachings for the priests' and at the end some prayers of a narrower circulation.The watermarks of the paper - representing a balance with round or triangular pans in a circle, an anchor in a circle and a cardinal's hat - are proof that it was made in Italy (most probably in Venice). The language of the text is Middle Bulgarian, as used in the Romanian manuscripts of the time, and not the Middle Serbian of the texts Macarie had printed in Montenegro. He arrived in the Romanian provinces fleeing from the Turkish invasion. Macarie's printing is different in its letter characteristics from that of Montenegro and Venice, as it was influenced by the lettering of the Romanian manuscripts of the time. The page reproduced here is verso of leaf 3 from book ã(1): frontispiece with the Wallachia coat of arms and the title: 'Divine Service after the Saint of Our Father, John the Well-Spoken'. The coat of arms represents the eagle with the cross in its beak in a wide square formed by interwoven stems of plants, depicted in a conventionalized manner, a style that could be called Byzantine flamboyant, in which luxuriance in decoration mixes with floral elements of the Byzantine kind.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The work dates - approximately - from the 1780s. It was the period when Hokusai - then pupil of the famous painter of actors, Katsukawa Shunshõ - had been authorized by his master to use one of the characters in the latter's name. Therefore, a great number of engravings from that period were signed Shunrõ. The engraving presented here is one of these. The Japanese specialists who have studied the works of Hokusai in the National Library engravings collection maintain that, at present, only two other copies of this issue are to be found in the world: one in Tokyo and another at the British Museum in London.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This Latin translation (by Petrus Desrey?) of the later-date variant of the medieval French ballad ("La dance macabre nouvelle") served as basis for the 14 French editions published between 1485 and 1500. The illustrations in these editions are considered the acme of the 15th century French woodcut engraving. The 40 characters who are dancing with Death form a gallery of specific physiognomies and costumes from all walks of life and trades in the late 15th century France, precisely depicted by an artist of the time.The book represents the only Latin edition. In colophon: Guido Mercator pro Geoffroy de Marnef. An extremely rare book, G W mentions seven copies. This is the only copy in Romania. The text is structured in one and two columns, 40 lines per page, 22.3 x 16 cm, printed in Gothic letters, with engraved initial letter of the title. The copy is complete and well preserved. It has a contemporary hardcover binding, with marbled paper flyleaves, the title and year of publication appearing in gold letters on the spine.The page reproduced here shows - on two columns - the discussions between Death and Legatus (the Papal representative) and between Death and Dux (Duke). The two groups are symmetrically placed under two archways joined together by Death's extended arms that lead them under the sign of cross. Death talks to both of them about the futility of their lifetime endeavours and they lament their vain efforts.</dc:description>

Oktoikh is one of the most widespread liturgical books of the Orthodox church. The text is prefaced with a frontispiece with a picture of the crucifix, at the end there is a colophon complete with printer's mark. The ornamental attire of the book is modest and made up of one headpiece and one initial. In the world there are seven copies of the book of five hundred years, with the only complete one being kept by the Russian State library. In the past the book was owned by Wroclaw reformer and bibliophile Johann Hess (1490 to 1547).</dc:description>

The eldest entry in one of the copies of the "Gospel" kept by the Russian state library in Moscow in Russia was made in 1558.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>"Acts and Epistles of the Apostles" or as the book is generally called "Apostle" is the first Russian printed publication, which is exactly dated. The book was brought out by the renowned Moscow enlightened Ivan Fedorov (about 1510 to 1583). The work on the "Apostle" began on the 19th of April 1563 and finished on the 1st of March, 1564. In the afterward to the book Ivan Fedora briefly set forth the history of the origins of the first Moscow state printing house founded on the initiative of the tsar Ivan the Terrible. The ratio of the height to the width of the type page is 210 x 140 mm and is close to the so-called golden section. In thoroughly thought out proportions and perfect polygraphic execution lies the secret of that impression of harmony and shapeliness which the book produces. Rich and peculiar is the artistic attire of the book. Apostle Luke is depicted on the frontispiece, the book has 48 artistic headpieces transferred from 20 boards.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The Gospel belonged to Tsar Fyodor Alekseyevich but in 1677 he bestowed it on boyar Bogdan Matveevich Khitrovo, who in the same year handed it over to the Troitse-Sergiev cloister. The book is written in the Russian uncial in two colomns on 300 parchment sheets of the size 32,2 x 24,8 cm. The binding is made of boards covered by velvet. There are silver engraved corners with the evangelists and an intercolomn space with the crucifix and interceding saints on the upper case and five oval silver beetles on the lower one (the binding was executed in the 17th century).There are eight miniatures in the book: four with pictures of the evangelists and four with the depictions of the evangelists' symbols - an eagle, an angel, a lion, a bull - preceding their pictures. Prior to the 'Khitrovo Gospel' no symbols of the evangelists were ever depicted on separate sheets in Russian manuscripts,which constitutes its iconographic peculiarity. They are painted in round lockets against a golden background with amazing freedom. The portrayal of the angel is reputed to rank among the best works of Russian medieval painting. Just this miniature is thought to be executed by Andrei Rublyov. There are four headpieces and plenty initial letters in the book - all of them are painted in colours and gold. The Khitrovo Gospel had constantly been kept in the sacristy of the Troitse-Sergieva lavra. After the nationalisation of the monastic library it was incorporated in the holdings of the Russian State Library.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Collection of engravings and dispatches dealing with operations of the Russian army against the Swedes during the Northern war. It was Peter the first who took the most active part in preparing and editing the book. The engravings were executed by A. Rostovtsev, A. Zubov, P. Pikart, A. Schonbek. In 1713 the publication of the "Book of Mars" remained unfinished: apart from main engravings and explanatory notes related to the events from 1702 to 1710, in some copies of the "Book of Mars", there were additional sheets of engravings and dispatches applying to hostilities from the subsequent years. The "'Book of Mars" has come down to us in but few copies differing from each other in number of engravings and dispatches. The Russian state library possesses two copies.</dc:description>

Ivan Kirilov who was a chief-secretary of the Senate (the highest state body of Russia under the Emperor) was the direct survey organizer, the manager of the atlas creating efforts, and the executor of a number of maps. This publication is the first printed atlas of Russia. The maps of the atlas formed a visual notion of Russia on the whole and its individual parts to the wide sections of the community first in the Russian state history. Four copies of the atlas are known only. Illustration: A map of Olonets uyezd. St.Petersburg, 1728. 1 sheet. Etching, engraver's tool, water-colour. There are several allegoric plots in the artistic cartouche of the map: empire prosperity, naval power greatness, uyezd richness in water resources, carrying out the 1st state country survey during which this map has been created.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The 'Ostromir Gospel' is Russia's earliest surviving dated manuscript. Produced in Kiev by the clerk Gregorius and commissioned by an eminent voevoda (commander) and posadnik (city governor) Ostromir, the Gospel served as Ostromir's contribution to St. Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod. The manuscript is written on parchment in large ustav, Russian earliest book script. The resplendent decoration involves three miniatures showing the Apostles, head pieces and large initials in Old Byzantine style with zoomorphic components.The 'Ostromir Gospel' is of an Aprokos Gospel type, the main section containing everyday Gospel texts to be read between Easter and Pentecost, as well as Saturday and Sunday readings for the subsequent weeks in the year; in the second section of the 'Ostromir Gospel' the readings are arranged on a calendar principle, the titles listing the saints to be commemorated on each particular day. The Menologium of the 'Ostromir Gospel' and the decoration of the manuscript reflect the cultural and political relations maintained by the Kiev Rus during the rule of Yaroslav the Wise with almost all European countries, thus extending the importance of this monument beyond the range of Byzantine and Slavonic manuscript tradition. The Ostromir Gospel is a major artefact of worldwide significance, a relevant source for studies in linguistics, paleography, book science, and the art and culture of mid-11th century Russia.</dc:description>

Bryus. It was the first Russian private publishing house. Together with the foundation of the Publishing House V.O. Kipriyanov got the monopoly to the publication and realization of engravings in Moscow. The Publishing House published training aids, maps, calendars, portraits, tables mainly for the Mathematical-navigational School. Kipriyanov opened a library attached to the Publishing House to hold and realize his publications. Illustration: above hemispheres a half-length portrait of Peter I by P.

		<dc:description>An evidence of the heroic age of the Battle at Kulikovo, the Kiev Psalter is an outstanding monument of Old Russian book heritage. Commissioned by Bishop Michael in Kiev and written by archdeacon Spiridon on parchment in large ustav, the manuscript contains the Psalter, a most expressive Old Testament book ascribed to David, a legendary King of Israel. The psalter consists of 150 canonical psalms and one additional, unnumbered psalm lacking in the Hebrew Bible and only appearing in the Greek translation. Most of the psalms in the manuscript have illuminated margins of exceptional artistic quality. The subjects of the miniatures represent interpreting comments to the psalms. Miniatures in the Kiev Psalter provide in extension of many centuries of Byzantine tradition in psalm illumination and an underlying principle in illuminating this type of Old Russian Psalters.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The 'Local Foundation', at the National Library and Book Patrimony of the Republic of San Marino, is of great importance in that it represents one of the strongest sources of evidence for the Republic of San Marino’s existence and history. The first collection of San Marino’s statutes that we have proof of are dated 1295. New dispositions and reforms followed later in 1317, 1353, 1491 and in the second half of the 16th century. The 'Statuta Decreta ac Ordinamenta Illustris Reipublicae ac Perpetua Libertatis Terrae Sancti Marini', dated 1600, are a re-elaboration of all the previous statutory materials, extended and systematically arranged in their definitive form, that regulated the State’s existence in each of it’s aspects. Such a prominent legislative work was able to resist the passing of time. In fact, after three centuries, these statutes, with the appropriate modifications made necessary by various changes in historical situations, are still in force in San Marino. Reproduced here is the title page of the 'Statutes' with the image of Saint Marino holding the three towers, the symbol of the territory of the ancient Republic.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Pierandrea Matthioli (1500-1577), formerly a famous physician, dedicated himself to botanic studies and became the most important phytologist of his times. With this commentary the author gave new prestige to Dioscoride’s famous “Materia Medica” (1st century A.C.). Besides translating the text, he clarified the most difficult passages and integrated it with the results of his long researches and accurate observations, giving medical studies a greater scientific rigour. He gathered and examined a great number of samples and hundreds of unknown medicinal plants, mentioning many of them for the first time and providing precise descriptions of their morphology and therapeutical applications. Thus Matthioli produced a real masterpiece and increased its value accluding magnificent illustrations artisticly engaved by Giorgio Liberale. The text was translated into many languages and used as the classic text-book for pharmacological studies for over two centuries. The page reproduced here shows one of the many precious water color figures from Matthioli’s naturalistic treatise.</dc:description>

In fact the Concerti Spirituali are an example of beautiful music performed by stringed instruments and choirs in line with the musical tradition of the finest italian courts of the period. On August 1, 1637, F. M. Marini Maestro di Cappella in the Republic of San Marino addressed his 27 spiritual concerts to his “Distinguished and honourable Lords and Rulers Heads of State and Captains of the Republic of San Marino”. The Concerts are composed by five parts ( Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass and Bass organ ), only the Alto part is conserved in San Marino, the complete five books are in the Conservatory Library “Martini” in Bologna and in the Oxford Church Library. The page above shows the title page of the “Concerti Spirituali” with the reproduction of a blazon of the Republic of San Marino never published elsewhere.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Parimeinik - the oldest representative of second, so called Lobkovian redaction of Parimeinik, which continues Old Slavonic tradition. The manuscript belonged to the old collection of the National Library of Serbia. It disappeared during evacuation in 1915. Afterwards, it has been found in the Federal Republic of Germany, where it was bought for the National Library of Serbia in 1969. The National Library of Serbia has as a part of its collection one more sheet of Parimeinik (Rs 2), for which it could be presumed that it belonged to this manuscript. This document, with its scripture and the whole appearance, belongs to a group of the most beautiful and monumental manuscripts of early Serbian writing ever to be created. According to its paleographic and orthographic characteristics the manuscript was written over the period of the first quarter of XIII century. According to the text, from which remain only some parts of parimia, from Wednesday night of the first week of fasting until Friday of the Floral week (Palm Sunday), the Manuscript had to be much bigger. The redaction version of Belgrade's Parimeinik is Serbian.Most of the sheets have been damaged. The size of sheets is not the original one, since the manuscript was cut off during the process of patching and rebinding. The major part of the text has gone through strict and consistently conducted constructive system. It has been written in two columns with dark color ink, and with carefully drown majuscule letters. For this style of writing a high contrast between dominating strong stalks of letters and thin lines of its junctions, nooses and bars, where the last ones are strengthen with triangular endings, has been characteristic. Multitudes of initials, appearing in this manuscript, have mainly been shaped with ribbons and vine-like stems, which are intertwined. Seldom, an animal, or just somewhere a human figure, suggests with its posture the shape of a letter. The way the text has been illuminated was conducted consistently as well: the beginnings of the main text parts are decorated with miniatures, and their headings, as well as the headings of smaller compositions within these parts of the manuscript, have been marked with red ink. With the same color ink the smaller initials have been shaped as well as some initial letters beside the major composition of these parts, decorated with a big decorative initial, the essential illumination element of this manuscript.</dc:description>

The plan of Belgrade area, imagined and released in an unique baroque composition, with Belgrade vedute, the movements of conquering armies and scenes of people migrations, presents a first class cartographic source for researching of medieval Belgrade and Serbia. The Gumpp’s plan launched the interest for Belgrade with no doubts: after its publishing, only a few atlases missed the folio with Belgrade city plan.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The former owner, P. Sreckovic, has found the Code in Albanian village, near Skadar, in 1875, where it was kept by an Serbian Orthodox priest. In 1902, Serbian Ministry bought it for the National Library. During the First World War in 1915, it disappeared together with a large group of manuscripts. It was later found in the Federal Republic of Germany, and in 1969, the manuscript was bought for the National library of Serbia. The manuscript is badly damaged. It is obvious that it was consumed by fire somewhere. All sheets are burnt around the edges, and the first and the last sheet are totally dark and crisp. The manuscript was retaured in the National Library of Serbia in 1974. There is a note of the scribe, Presbyter Vasili, known as priest Dragolj, after whom the Code was named. Scientists could not agree on its date of origin; the date varied from the beginning of the 13th to the beginning of the 14th century. Based on the historical datas, Ð. Sp. Radojicic had limited the possible dates of the creation of the original of Dragolj`s Code to the year 1259, as the earliest year in which it could be created. Together with conclusions obtained by analyzing script and orthography, the creation of Dragolj`s Code can be situated in the third quarter of the 13th century.Dragolj`s Code is written in medium size uncial script, on roughly treated parchment of unequal thickness and edges. The handwriting of the scribe is not quite even. The script, regarded as a whole unit, seems archaic. This mentioned archaism is especially emphasized by the lack of diactrical marks. The redaction version is Serbian. A few language characteristics, which appear in this Code, are known from some of our early monuments, which originated from the region of Zeta and Hum. The vocabulary of the Code is very interesting, but it needs to be studied more carefully. The Code contains various, mostly apocryphal texts. It includes: Adaptation of Kozma`s Sermon against Bogomils, which probably originates from Serbian monastery Žica; Philosopy and Intellect, the translation of Greek citations in prose and also quotes in verses which are believed to belong to Menander; Story of the White Man by Kiril Turovski; Pandeh`s uttered Predictio; and others apocryphal texts.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Zenit, the international magazine for art and culture, has been launched by avant-garde artist Ljubomir Micić (1895-1971) in February 1921 in Zagreb. It’s been published there monthly up to 1923, and thereafter in Belgrade till the last issue in December 1926, when the magazine has been forbidden. A total of 43 issues were published, as well as one poster Zenitsmus, and one issue of daily Zenit Newspaper dated 23 Septemebr 1922. Besides Ljubomir Micić, other people have taken part in the editing of Zenit, like Boško Tokin, Rastko Petrović, Branko Ve Poljanski and Ivan Goll. The contributors were: Miloš Crnjanski, Dušan Matić, Stanislav Vinaver, Alexander Blok, Jaroslav Seifert, Wassily Kandinsky and others.Zenit is the most significant avant-garde magazine in the territory of former Yugoslavia and one of the most significant within the context of European avant-garde. By its programme, Zenit is basically international: it gravitated to the creation of one completely new and united Europe, disregarding the races, nationalities, languages, ideas or ideologies. In many ideas, it was an attempt of new Babylon palace building in spite of mixed nations. Zenitism is the avant-guard movement born around Zenit magazine. The Zenitism Manifest is published in June 1921 and was proclaiming the humanism аnd anti-war ideas. Western European culture is spiritually bankrupt, according to Micic, but Zenitism, the embodiment of the Balkan “barbaro-genius”, will revitalize it. The Zenit collection belongs to special collections of National library of Serbia, as a part of the Ljubomir Micić’s legacy.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Scribe and place of writing are unknown. The manuscript is dated according to watermarks on the paper. The manuscript remained in the old collection of the National Library of Serbia til 1861. During the war evacuation in Belgrade in the year 1915, it disappeared together with other valuable library books. In 1933 it reappeared, when one book shop from Germany offered it for purchase to the National Library; it turns out that a German military officer, Von Vilkens, saved it from the flames and took the manuscript with him to Germany. After some diplomatic negociations, the manuscript was returned to the Yugoslavia in 1934, and was given tothe National Museum (at that time called Museum of Art). The Museum donated the manuscript to the National Library of Serbia on the occasion of its moving to the new building in 1973.The text is written with an uniform, semiuncial script, although not so calligraphic. The redaction version is Serbian, the orthography is Resavian. The illuminations are very modest and comes to one square flag and simple cinober initials; the text is followed by "vivid marks". The binding is composed of wooden plates, covered with leather in dark color, with blind impression. The manuscript contains: Abbreviated Syntagma of Matija Vlastar; Rules of Jovan Posnik; Questions and Answers about the Church by St. Vasili; Justinian's Code; Code of Tzar Dushan; short rules for fasting and Epistle of patriarch Genadi (both of these contents are a supplement from 1570/80). Therefore, this is a Legal Code of common content. The special value of the Manuscript is in its most completely preserved text of the Dushan`s Code til now (186 articles), copied from a great original model, very close to the unpreserved original text of the most important Serbian Medieval Legal Act.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This one-sheet incunabulum was discovered in the binding of a historical print. Damaged text is printed on one side in German language. The first sentence begins with a woodcut initial N[ach]. From the analysis of the hand-written exlibris located on the blank page, and from the border of the Almanac, which was in its half line cut up, it is possible to deduce, that it was a fly leaf of a contemporary print. The incunable is a unique item, which was not in evidence of world incunabula bibliographies until 1967. The editorial office of "Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke" in Berlin registered this unit on the basis of information of Dr. Boris Bálent, a staff member of SNL. Afterwards this world unique document was registered in supplement list (Gw n. 1380/10).</dc:description>

		<dc:description>'Bardejovian katechysmus' from 1581 is considered as the first printed book issued in the Slovak language on Slovak territory. Its exceptional value was already appreciated by Slovak enlighteners, who took this unit in the catalogues of their personal libraries. In the past 'Bardejovian katechysmus' was often confounded with Pruno's katechysmus in bibliographies . Regarding its content, the work presents and interprets the fundamental articles of the faith. From the linguistic point of view this issue is significant with occurrence of many Slovakian language elements (incorrect using of length mark, using the genitive of plural in function of acusative ...), which reflects the influences of East Slovakian dialects.First of all the introduction shows the author unbound with common stylistic phrases and dogmatic scribe convention. Probably it was a scholar from a region nearby. He worked as a visitator (maybe it was Severín Škultéty) in school environment. His relation to members of citizen rank is clear. Regarding the external formal characteristics of this issue it is possible to refer on simple but trimed typography with some fine ornamental borders and big initials. The printer of this work, David Gutgesel (1540-1599), was a pioneer of bookprinting in Bardejov. He learned this craft in Vienna. Besides the Roman type face and fracture he used also Greek and Hebraic type of face. Religious reformation literature was dominant in his production (for example Postilla of Leonard Stöckel). He published also school books, calendars and occassional publications.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The Hungarian Chronicle of Johannes de Thurocz is generally presented as the most extensive Hungarian work of this kind dating from the 15th century. The Chronicle was probably made on the impulse of significant country and royal dignitaries who were working in the Royal court of King Matthias Corvinus (Thomas Drági, regional judge and the Royal personnel, Stephen from Haserhag, general notary of the Royal court). In these surroundings Johannes de Thurocz, a member of Turiec a yeoman family, worked from 1475 as a general notary of a regional judge. Magister Johannes de Thurocz, as it has been explained in his own words formulated in the dedications of the work, did not intend to be a historiographer. The fact that he elaborated this Hungarian history resulted from the character of his profession and from a knowledge of the Latin language and law.The oldest period that is covered, the so-called 'Hunan chronicle' was elaborated on the basis of old Hungarian chronicles (Pictorial ch., Buda ch.), the so-called 'Gesta' and preserved manuscripts. In this interpretation of the history of the Hungarian Kingdom since the second arrival of Hungarians until the period of the reign of King Charles Robert of Anjou (1307-1342) Johannes de Thurocz started from non-Hungarian sources (historical-geographical Lexicon of Aeneus Silvius Piccolomini, the World chronicle of Antoninus, Bishop of Firenze). The next part of the work concerning the period of the reign of King Louis I the Great (1342-1382) was the work of magister Jan from Šarišské Sokolovce (Northern Slovakia) and Johannes de Thurocz inserted all of his earlier work into his own work. To this part he also attached an interpretation of the history of King Charles II the Small (Parvus), inspired by the work of Lorenzo de Monacis. The last part of the chronicle, elaborating the period after the death of King Charles II the Small (1386) until the conquest of Vienna and Vienna New City (Wiener Neustadt) by King Matthias Corvinus (1458-1490) in August 1487, can be considered as the own creation of Johannes de Thurocz. He was mainly inspired by the analysis of authentic diplomatic sources, letters and correspondence of significant personalities (Jan Vitez of Sredna, Jan Hunyadi).The Chronica Hungarorum was published many times. Besides the Moravian and Augsburgian issues from 1488later editions were published at Frankfurt, Vienna, Trnava and Budapest in the following centuries. The Chronica, is significant from the aspect of Slovak history and the national language for using some Slovak names of seats (Rosnawa-Roznava) and some specific notable persons (Zlowachko – Slovácko). No emphasis of the existence of the Slovak nation is expressed in this work. This is quite understandable because Slovakia and the Slovaks still did not form a specific autonomous administrative-political part of the Hungarian Kingdom. However, descriptions of events from the territory of Slovakia from 1439 show clearly that the Slovaks were distinguished from Czechs and Poles (...Bohemi, Poloni et Sclavi).</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Dalmatin's Bible is the first Slovenian translation of a complete Bible and as such overshadowed the significance of the earlier Trubar's translation of the New Testament, for its use was later, after the decline of the Slovene Protestant Church, also allowed among Catholic priests. Prior to this great work Dalmatin's translations of individual books of the Scriptures had been made and these served as a preparation for this final publication, printed in Wittenberg, Germany. Dalmatin's Bible established Slovene as a mature literary language and served as a model for further translations and original writings in the following two centuries. About 80 original copies have been preserved all over the world. Among them are 7 that are held in the National and University Library, Ljubljana.The title page shows the Slovene-German title, the name of the translator, the printer, and the date and place of printing. The text in black and red is set centrally within a woodcut frame, the same as used in Luther's German Bible. 1500 copies were originally printed, 50 of them on special paper and bound in white, red or black leather covering strong wooden bases. The book contains 222 woodcuts in Dürer's manner as were often used in contemporary German prints and numerous printed square initials. The typography used is Dürer's fracture, with the letters varying from 36 pt - 8 pt in the Didot sytem.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>'Collectarium' isa representative of an important group of medieval illuminated manuscripts produced in the late twelfth century in the Cistercian Monastery of Sticna. The manuscripts from this Slovene monastic scriptorium are in full and equal measure comparable with the others of contemporary Europe. Of the manuscripts from Sticna, 32 codices and five fragments have survived: 21 volumes and several fragments in the National and University Library in Ljubljana, 10 volumes in the Austrian National Library in Vienna, 1 volume in the Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenbüttel, Germany, and several other fragments in the Slovene National Archives.The volume cosists of several texts, the initial and the main one being Liber in Vitam Sancti Bernardi followed by Lives of the Apostles, Martyrs and Saints. The page reproduced here shows the painted initial B, fol. 3, introducing Life of St. Bernard. It is painted in pale green and pale blue, contains yellow fillings in the clevages of the letter, and is surrounded by a cinnabar frame. The initial is a result of the cooperation of Bernard, The Augustine and Gregory Masters, and the Master of the tubular Leaves.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The map, made by the priest, astronomer and geographer Janez Dizma Florjančič (1691-1757?), is one of the most important cartographic works of the Theresian period (1740-1780). The map is the first authentic, domestic, and high quality Slovenian map work, and it was largely used among the widest public. The map is the product of more than 10 years of the author's travels and cartographic measuring of Carniolia. Engraved in copper by Abraham Kaltscmidt, this masterpiece has dimensions of 180 x 188 cm. The approximate map scale is 1:100.000, and it changes on different parts of the map.An interesting curiosity can be seen in the landscape of Ljubljana, depicted in the upper right corner. Below the landscape, there is the first published plan of the capital Ljubljana, accurately prepared, with an approximate scale of 1:5.000 and a list of the main town buildings. The frame of the map decoration is rich and picturesque. The map title is profusely ornamented in the bottom right hand corner. Allegoric sculptures of land characteristics and arms of the nobility, who supported map making and publishing, happen to be the main title decorations.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Janez Vajkard Valvasor, Royal Society member in London, geographer, ethnographer, historian, cartographer, scientist, collector, painter and publisher, is one of the most important men who have ever lived and worked in Slovenia. His masterpiece, 'Die Ehre deß Hertzogthums Crain', is the most important work of the period between the Reformation and the age of Enlightenment. This masterpiece is the first systematic overview of Slovenian history, territory, and way of life.'Topographia Ducatus Carnioliae', printed in 1679, is an album of 320 engravings of towns, market towns, monasteries and castles in Carniolia. The engravings are paged in German alphabetic order. Slovenian names are added. At the end of the album Index in German and Slovenian is provided. The more extensive German index brings indications of town locations, and land owners are also given. The album represents an exceptionally valuable and picturesque source, indispensable to national identification. On the front page, the Ljubljana town hall, with the castle above, is shown. Above the town there is a flying angel with trumpets and flags. The Carniola's coat-of-arms can be clearly seen on one of the flags.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The Beatus manuscripts is the name given to a series of codices dating from the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries, which include the commentaries on the Apocalypse by Beatus, a presbyter who lived in Liébana (Asturias) in the second half of the 8th century. Other texts were then added to these commentaries on the Apocalypse, considered to be a model of Christian orthodoxy. These include, in particular, St Jerome's "Commentaries on the Book of Daniel" and an extract from St. Augustine's "The City of God" on the Antichrist and his names.This set of doctrinal works acquired considerable significance between the 10th and early 12th centuries, during which time twelve copies were made in Spain and two abroad. The tradition was renewed in the second half of the 12th century, as a result of which nine further copies were produced. To this set of 23 preserved copies can be added many other codices that are known to have existed, making this a genuine medieval 'best-seller', which gained its initial impetus from the proximity of the year 1000 and the fear that the world was about to come to an end. The "Codex of Ferdinand I and Sancha", which is preserved in the Spanish National Library, is the only one that seems - in view of the richness of its decoration - not to have been copied for a monastery but rather for this particular King and Queen, whose names and portraits appear in different parts of the book.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This is a work of the utmost importance in Spanish cartography because it is both the first atlas of Spain which was produced by a Spaniard and the first one to be commercially published, as a result of which it became a huge success. Its author, Tomás López (1730-1802), was sent to Paris for a number of years by the Marqués of Ensenada, the War and Treasury Minister at that time, so that he would learn cartography and map engraving under the tutelage of d'Anville, who was a "desk geographer" as López himself would later become.Tomás López, engraver and publisher of his own cartographic work, was responsible for the most important work of this type produced in Spain until that time. He was constantly active and published more than two hundred maps in the course of his life. In 1804, after his death, his children edited the atlas which contained the best of his work under the title "Geographical Atlas of Spain including the General Map of the Kingdom and the Particulars of its Provinces". They were also responsible for the 1810 reprint and the new 1830 edition. In 1844, Beltrán Sober re-edited the work as part of a new atlas and numerous facsimile reproductions are currently being produced from it.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The "Cantar de Mío Cid" ("The Song of the Cid") is the first epic poem in Spanish literature which is preserved in its entirety and it is also the first extensive composition to be written in a Romance language in the Iberian Peninsula. It tells of the deeds of Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, the Cid Campeador, who lived under the reign of Alfonso VI of Castile, the king who sent him into exile in 1081. The Spanish hero who, over the years, has inspired a wealth of literary works and films in many different countries, is here endowed with a humanity not found in any other epic poems. His most notable traits are wisdom, tenderness towards his family and temperance, which is made manifest in his steadfast loyalty towards his king.The 14th century codex preserved in the Spanish National Library contains the copy made by Per Abbat in 1245 of the Hispanic era, which corresponds to the year 1207. The copy was taken from another earlier manuscript which has since been lost. The first page of this codex is missing as are two more inside and it has also deteriorated as a result of certain chemical products which were applied in the 16th and 19th centuries to help read the text. It is now the only remaining copy of this ancient poem, which the prestigious Spanish philologist Menéndez Pidal dated back to 1140 and later scholars believed to date from the late 12th century. Despite the dispute regarding its exact date, the work is of inestimable value, both for the research on the history of the Spanish language and for what it can tell us about the literary and social history of its day. The poem has a markedly realistic tone and is full of details taken from everyday life.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The Spanish Romantic poet, Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer (Seville 1836-Madrid 1870), delivered a manuscript of his poems to his patron, the Government Minister Luis González Bravo, who was to write a preface for them. However, this manuscript was lost in the 1868 Revolution. Bécquer attempted to reconstruct what had been lost in his "Libro de los Gorriones" ("Book of the Sparrows"), a notebook he wrote himself and in which he added some prose pieces ("Symphonic introduction", and an incomplete story entitled "The stone woman"), to his famous "Rimas". It was this manuscript, corrected by his friends, which served as the basis for the posthumous 1871 edition and which is still used for current editions of the "Rimas".</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The literary, scientific and cultural magnum opus, Suecia antiqua et hodierna is a work of distinction from Sweden's period as a great power. The background, from which this major work evolved from, is known as an era of culture and peace that emanated from the Treaty of Westphalia. The work was for its time considered exceptional with regard to both the depth and width of the inventory and the quality set by the draughtsmanship and the use of the, by then quite modern technique, of engraving and etching onto copper plates. High standards were set and some of the most prominent copper plate engravers from France and Holland were offered contracts. The project spanned several decades, plagued by setbacks and various alterations, eventually reaching a conclusion.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>King Charles XII (1682-1718) is one of the Swedish kings who has earned international reputation. Above all he is famous because of his war against Denmark, Saxony and Russia, which in 1699 was leagued together against Sweden. This unsigned, half-length portrait of Charles XII, belonging to the KB, has been ascribed to Johan Swartz, who was disciple of the famous painter David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl. The portrait was acquried by the KB in 1919 and is considered to be among the most valuable items in the collection of hand drawn portraits. The artist's immediate perception, especially of the model’s eye, speaks for the presumption that the king actually posed for his portrait. Judging by the coulour indications written in German on the drawing, this is a sketch of a painting. The young king’s vigorous appeareance and thin hair indicates that the sketch was drawn during the suspension of hostilities in Altranstädt 1706-1707, where the king sat twice for Swartz.The portraits of Charles XII from the Altranstädt period went against all conventions for royal portraits at that time. According to several historical sources the king himself dictated that the portraits should focus on the image of the “soldier-king” and the conception of his unaffected manners. He had previously dropped his wig and had his hair cut short in order to brush it back. Accordingly, the ornamented court dress was replaced by a blue tunic, with or without cuirass. When reaching the Swedish capital the portraits from Altranstädt caused immediate attention. An eyewitness who compared one of Swartz’ completed paintings with the model could only state that the portrait completly resembled the features of the king: Swartz had reproduced the king’s sun tan as well as measles scars.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Erik Dahlberg had certain assistants during his preparatory work for 'Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna' (1st edition 1716). However, he himself adapted those drawings with which he had been supplied, and supervized the work of the engravers. This control over the work process was a decisive factor in The Suecia becoming a work comparable with the best of such works produced in 17th-century Europe. The drawings for The Suecia, which for the greater part are stored in the Royal Swedish Library, make it possible to reconstruct the work process. Those sketches made on location are in pencil. With the aid of the latter, drafts were produced, usually using quill and ink. These drafts in turn formed the basis for the final versions of the drawings, which were generally carried out in pencil and washed in grey.The process from the sketch through to the final version was complicated, and involved several interim stages. Great pains were taken to maintain uniformity of perspective. The broad panorama of Stockholm viewed from the west was preceded by comprehensive preparatory studies, and the sketches are witness to the careful and precise manner of drawing which characterizes Dahlberg’s early drafts. The summary treatment of the foreground, however, shows a freer style linked to the Merian tradition. This sheet is one of several examples of the way Dahlberg turned the paper during the course of work so as to make use of space; the left half of the panorama is drawn along one long side and the right half along the opposite long side. A comparison between the sketch and the finished copperplate engraving show amongst other things that the figures Dahlberg drew into the landscape generally only gave rough indications, which the engravers were then allowed to elaborate in order "to enrich and embellish the work".</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Alfred Nobel was born in Stockholm on October 21, 1833. He concentrated on developing nitroglycerine as an explosive and found that mixing nitroglycerine with silica would turn the liquid into a paste which could be shaped into rods of a size and form suitable for insertion into drilling holes. In 1867 he patented this material under the name of dynamite. Since 1901, the Nobel Prizes have been presented to the Laureates at ceremonieson December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. As stipulated in the will which was opened after his death in 1896, the Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine and Literature are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden, while the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway.Since 1969 an additional prize has been awarded at the ceremony in Stockholm, the Sveriges Riksbank (Bank of Sweden) Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, which was established in 1968 on the occasion of the Riksbank's 300th anniversary. The Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm has, almost without exception, taken place at the Stockholm Concert Hall (Stockholms Konserthus) since 1926. The Ceremony is followed by a banquet. In 1901 it was held at Grand Hotel, Stockholm. Since 1926, with a few exceptions, the Nobel Banquet has taken place at the City Hall (Stockholms Stadshus). The Nobel Festivities in Stockholm are arranged by the Nobel Foundation and are primarily an academic celebration focusing on science and literature.Recommended link:</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Recently St. Birgitta of Sweden became a patroness of Europe together with two other female saints. St. Birgitta, the only woman canonised in the fourteenth century (1391), was already during her lifetime (1303-1373) one of the most intriguing persons in Europe. Through her revelations - Revelaciones - she tried to influence ecclesiastical life in Rome as well as the politics of the European royal courts. In most cases her revelations were written down in Latin by her confessors, but there are two unique documents in which Birgitta herself has written down two of her revelations in Swedish. The smaller autograph (B) is depicted above. The beginning of the text reads 'fyrst vil iac Þik sighia huru Þik aeru andelik understandilse gifin sea oc hora' i.e. 'First I want to tell you how you are given spiritual understanding to see and hear', which in the Latin version is rendered 'intelligentia spiritualium visionum' i.e. 'the understanding of spiritual visions'.The Latin text is found in the Revelaciones, book VIII, chapter 56. It is the Virgin Mary who turns to Birgitta in an apparition and speaks to her. This particular revelation, probably from 1361, had political implications in Sweden at the time. In the revelation St. Birgitta turns to four instigators, mentioned by name, giving them instructions for a rebellion against the Swedish King Magnus. Later, when the revelation was translated into Latin, some changes to the content had been made in order to suit readers in other parts of Europe. The king’s name, for instance, does not appear in the Latin version. As regards the manuscript itself, at some time the names of the four instigators have been erased. The erasing can clearly be seen at the end of line 11 in the text above.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The 'Devil's Bible' (89,5 x 49 cm, weighs 75 kg), contains the Old and New Testaments in pre-Vulgate Latin translations, Isidore of Seville's 'Etymologiae', Josephus' 'History of the Jews' in a Latin translation, the 'Chronicle of Bohemia', written by Cosmas of Prague, etc. The manuscript was written in the early 13th century in the Benedictine monastery of Podlazice in Bohemia, the vellum used having been prepared from 160 calf skins.It is called the 'Devil's Bible' after the impressive picture of that potentate. According to legend the scribe was a monk who had been confined to his cell for some breach of monastic discipline and who, by way of penance, finished the manuscript in one single night with the aid of the Devil whom he had summoned to help him. In 1594 the manuscript was acquired by the Imperial Treasury in Prague. When the Swedish army conquered the city in 1648, it was brought to Sweden and presented to the KB the following year.Click</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Alonzo de Santa Cruz (d. 1572) is the most renowned of the cartographers of the Council of Indian Affairs - Casa de Contratación - in Seville entrusted with the Padrón Real, the great and exemplary Spanish map of the discoveries in the New World. Of the very few of his works which are preserved, two are in Sweden, probably having been acquired by Johan Gabriel Sparfvenfeldt during his 1689-94 journeys in search of monuments with connections to the ancient Goths. A remarkable map of the city of Mexico is kept in the Uppsala University Library.The present world map in the form of globe gores in two hemispheres – a northern and a southern – has a waved scroll across the top bearing the inscription: Nova verior et integra totius orbis descriptio nunc primum in lucem edita per Alfonsum de Sancta Cruz Caesaris Charoli V archicosmographum, A.D. MDXLII. ‘A very new and complete description of the whole world now first prepared by Alfonso de Santa Cruz Cosmographer Major of the Emperor Charles V.’ At the bottom is a dedication to the emperor and a black eagle with the imperial arms.The hemispheres are each made up of 36 gores, the whole representing a globe with a diameter of 39 cm. The rich embellishment, however, indicates that the map was not intended for pasting onto a globe. It gives a tolerably accurate impression of the layout of the Padrón Real. Inscriptions by California refer to discoveries made as late as 1539. Other parts of the map, e.g. Scandinavia, display coastlines copied from the 1482 Ptolemy edition. Amongst the place names, which are about 1240 in number, we find the first mention of the names Rio de la Plata and Buenos Aires.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This poster from the Olympic Summer Games in Stockholm 1912 was drawn by Olle Hjortzberg (1872-1959), a well-known Swedish artist and decorator. He was versatile and his works includes ecclesiastical drawing, bookbinding and portrait painting. The drawing in this poster represents Art Nouveau, with decorative floating lines. It was to carry the Swedish colours around the world. Art Nouveau played an important role in this complex period with the beginning of mass advertising. The nakedness of the men, in classic Greek Olympic style, drew some attention and Hjortzberg solved this problem by using the Art Nouveau ribbons were they were most needed. The Olympic Games in Stockholm were a success for Sweden, and the Swedish athletes won more medals than anyone else.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Albrecht von Haller (1708-1777), a Bernese patrician, was by profession a physician and naturalist trained in Tübingen, Leiden, London, and Paris. He occupied, from 1736 to 1753, the chair of anatomy, botany, and surgery at the University of Göttingen; from 1758 to 1768 he was director of the Bernese salt works at Roche, near Lake Geneva. Haller's significant output of scientific publications and his immense quantity of correspondence with scholars across all of Europe make him one of the most impressive figures of the 18th century.The poem 'Die Alpen' ('The Alps') is the fruit of an excursion through the Swiss mountains, undertaken in 1728, and was first published in 1732, in a small volume entitled 'Versuch Schweizerischer Gedichten', for Goethe 'the beginning of a national German literature'. 'Die Alpen' opened the eyes of Haller's contemporaries in many countries to the beauty of the Swiss mountains. It is a work not only of poetry but also of erudition, as Haller added a number of learned footnotes for the benefit of the not-so-well-informed reader.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The Old Manuscript Collection in the National and University Library "St. Kliment Ohridski"- Skopje is responsible for discovering, recording, collecting, studying, holding and lending of the old manuscripts from Macedonia. The Collection contains 244 manuscripts, 233 of which are Slavic and 21 in other languages and scripts. One of the most significant Slavic manuscripts in this Collection is the Kratovo Four Gospels from the Macedonian Literary School of Kratovo dating from the middle of the 14th century. From this Manuscript 151 sheets have been preserved. The script of the first two sheets is a nice calligraphic uncial writing from the 14th century; the rest of the text is written with simpler uncial writing, containing semi- uncial elements; it had been written by three different persons. The redaction is Macedonian of the School of Kratovo. The Manuscript has a modest but rather characteristic ornamentation. Two flags have been preserved: one at the beginning of the Gospel of Mark, sheet No.39 and at the beginning of the Gospel of Luke, sheet No.69. There is a green line on which red letters from the title are written- this is a particular type of ancient Macedonian ornamentation characteristic for the 12th and the 13th centuries. There are also round red initials with curved endings, characteristic for the middle of the 14th century.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>MAFĀTĪH AL-ĠAIB or AT-TAFSĪR AL-KABĪR, the Great Commentary of the Qur’an by Fakruddīn Abū ‘Abdullāh Muhammad b. ‘Umar b. al-Husain b. al-Katīb ar-Rāzī (544/1150 - 606/1209). The manuscript is one of the three discovered so far that belonged to one of the very first Islamic libraries in the Balkans, namely the library of Isa Bey, son of Ishaq Bey (better known as Isa-beg Isaković), the famous Ottoman general and the first governor of the Ottoman province of Bosnia. According to the Act of Endowment made by Isa Bey and ratified in 1469, it is known that, for the needs of his madrasa in Skopje, beside his numerous lands and shops, he endowed more than 330 bind volumes containing texts of the most famous Islamic scholars and authors of the time. This manuscript represents the 12th volume of the Great Commentary, which originally consisted of 16 bind volumes, as mentioned in the Isa Bey’s Act of Endowment. The volume is bound in brown leather binding with floral ornaments in the center and in the corners, that bear some traces of gilt. The text is copied by two scribes, the first up to the folio 202b, the second from the folio 293a onwards. None of them mentioned his name, time or place of copying. The manuscript is datable before 1469.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The Old Slavic manuscript collection housed in the Archeographic Department at the National and University Library "St Kliment Ohridski"- Skopje, Republic of Macedonia, numbers over 300 manuscripts. They represent an invaluable proof of the precious cultural and historical heritage and wealth found on Macedonian territory. All the manuscripts were hand written over a very long period of time and under extremely difficult conditions. An example of this kind of old Slavic manuscript is the displayed text from the Fast triod. The text is written on parchment. It consists of one sheet that was torn from a book and used as a cover for another book. Its dimensions are 27,5 x 19,5 cm. The writing is in two columns, very accurate uncial, by mixing old and new shapes. It is Macedonian redaction using orthography of the School of Kratovo. With respect to the ornamentation, the initial 'P' from the old geometric type of folk variant, typical for the old Macedonian manuscripts, has been preserved. It is displayed in a red colour having narrow white contours with slanting green lines. The initial letters from the titles are in red.The text is a fragment from the Fast triod in old Macedonian redaction - the text abounds in parimias (explicated texts from the Old Testament). The preserved fragment contains text from the night service on Monday, the first fast week. The text from the Old Testament book BEING, first chapter, from 9th to 13th verse row is on the front page. The opposite side of the page, which was on the outer side when the parchment served as a cover, is brownish and faded in the middle of the page, so that only two upper rows can be read. The text from Solomon's fables goes to the outer column of this page, where prokeimenons used to stand and the beginning of the title begins with the verse form of the letter 'G'. The end of the title is in the first row of the right column. The remaining text continuing to the end of the column is readable. This original Old Slavic manuscript is extremely significant, being the oldest one kept in the treasure-trove of the Library under strict conditions, established within the Library regarding the protection and conservation (temperature, dampness etc.) of such materials. Similar care is being taken of all other existing Old Slavic manuscripts in the Library.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This manuscript, apart from its cultural and historical importance, has a great artistic value. In addition to the illuminated opening double page it also containes an illuminated panel commemorating its bestowal as a pios endowment on the Ishaqiya mosque in Bitola. The Chapter of the Poets (Surat a{-[u`ara’) bears some interesting decorations too: on the four double pages the rubricated words and groups of words as well as their adjoining pictoral decorations are so arranged as to be mirrored on the facing pages, except for the last one where the text of the facing pages differs but adjoining decorations are still the same. The dots and the text frames are in gold throughout the text. The text of the Qur’an is written in black ink, the titles of the chapters in white on the golden background, while the words that “mirror” themselves on the facing pages are written in red.</dc:description>

It is organized each year in the town of Struga on the south-west of Macedonia.Struga is the capital of poetry and one of the cradles of the Macedonian spiritual revival in the 19th century, for it is the birthplace of the outstanding poets and educators, the brothers Dimitrija and Konstantin Miladinov. Here, one is charmed by the source of the Crn Drim river, which flows into Lake Ohrid and runs across it, only to emerge again with its clear and greenish water, and beautify the already delightful town of Struga. This town is a famous tourist resort, and it is an eternal inspiration for poets from all over the world. Since 1962, each year at the second half of August, the Struga Poetry Evenings held in honor of brothers Miladinov, have gathered poets from all the continents.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>After its completion the literary monument was kept in the Peresopnytsya Monastery. On 17 April 1701 it was presented to Pereyaslav Cathedral by Ivan Mazepa the Hetman of Ukraine. From 1799 it was kept in Pereyaslav Seminary. Later on it was held in Poltava Seminary, Poltava Museum of History and Regional Studies, Kyiv-Pecherska Lavra preserve. On 24 December 1948 this treasure of Ukrainian culture was placed at the National Library of Ukraine.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>The scribe, Mykhailo Vasyliyevych, a Syanok archpriest's son, worked under the leadership of archimandrite Hryhory of the Peresopnytsya Monastery, from 15 August 1556 (in the Dvoretsky Monastery of the Zheslavsky Princes) until 29 August 1561 (in Peresopnytsya Monastery, Volyn' region). The 'Peresopnytsya Gospel' is the first of several well-known translations of canonical texts into the Old Ukrainian language. This unique literary monument is distinguished by a luxurious design, made under the influence of the Italian Renaissance, but with characteristic Ukrainian ornaments, and a high artistic level of miniatures of the Ukrainian icon-painting school, which was connected with the Eastern Slavonic traditions. The Manuscript is written with various types of writing - decorative refined uncial (basic text) and semi-uncial with elements of cursive, dark-brown ink and cinnabar.This is a quaternary Gospel in content. At the beginning of the book there is the science of reading, then there are four Gospels, each of which is prefaced with an index of chapters (paràbles) and a foreword, and completed with a note; at the end there is a colophon, Misyatseslov, and the scribe's note. The text is divided into chapters, each of which begins with a summary and zachalo. There are continuously available glosses, i.e. Ukrainian lexical analogues to the original words. The Volyn region's Princess Nastacia Yuriyivna Zheslavska-Holshanska (Zaslavska-Olshanska), her daughter and her son-in-law (Yevdokiya and Ivan Fedorovych Chertoryzky), the well known patrons of art and literature, were the commisioning customers for the 'Peresopnytsya Gospel'.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Penny dreadfuls - sensational stories published in weekly parts - were an important feature of Victorian popular literature. Often anonymous, and inspired by the melodramas of the day, they formed a lively part of 19th century sub-culture in Britain. One of the most comprehensive collections of these scarce and fragile items was built up and then bequeathed to the British Library by music-hall performer Barry Ono (real name Frederick Valentine Harrison) in 1948. It contains almost 700 penny novels and magazines, together with advertising posters, handbills, manuscript notes and letters.'Black Bess; or, The knight of the road', published in 254 parts and frequently reprinted, is one of the highlights of the collection - its plot loosely based on the story of the highwayman, Dick Turpin, and full of wild adventures, narrow escapes, and improbable incidents. Although attributed to Edward Viles, a well-known author of the genre, it is generally accepted that the dramatist and journalist, John Frederick Smith, had some responsibility for the text. The copy in the Ono collection contains 20 plates, originally given free with the parts to attract customers, and is bound with 2 sets of wrappers and 4 additional front covers for different editions or issues of the work.</dc:description>

		<dc:subject>Bible</dc:subject>
		<dc:description>This Bible, the first large-scale use of the invention of movable printing-type in the West, was the work of a partnership dissolved in 1455 after the work was complete. Work was well advanced by the end of 1454, as attested by Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini (later Pope Pius II) in a letter of 12 March 1455 to Cardinal Juan de Carvajal: ‘Nothing has been exaggerated about that amazing man near Frankfurt. I have not seen complete copies of his Bible, but I did see quires of various parts of the text, in very fine and proper letters which Your Honour could read without any trouble and without using your glasses. ... I shall try to buy a volume for you but I fear this will not be possible, not only because of the distance, but because copies are sold even before they are completed.’ Many, including this lavishly decorated paper copy, married the new technology with the old, combining print with high-quality illumination. The result set a standard in book production in many ways still unsurpassed today. 51 copies are now known, of which 12 are printed on vellum and 39 on paper; 20 are perfect. The British Library owns two of these, on both paper and vellum.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>'Magna Carta' is one of the most famous of all documents, widely regarded as the corner-stone of liberty in the English-speaking world. It does not, however, contain any sweeping statements of principle; instead its text consists of a series of detailed concessions on legal procedure and feudal rights wrung from an unwilling King John (reigned 1199-1216) by his noble opponents in 1215. 'Magna Carta' has long been considered the chief constitutional defence against arbitrary and unjust rule in England. It was effectively a treaty of peace between King John and a group of leading noblemen who had rebelled against him for reasons the charter itself makes clear: his financial and military demands to aid his foreign wars were oppressive; taxation was arbitrary and extortionate; the King imposed arbitrary punishments; and feudal rights were ruthlessly exploited for financial gain.In the course of a meeting in June 1215 between the King and the nobles at Runnymede, near Windsor, a document was presented summarising the nobles' demands. John's Great Seal was fixed to this document to signify his assent to it. The document sealed at Runnymede is probably that known as the Articles of the Barons, which is also in the British Library. The royal chancery then turned the list of demands into a formal grant in the name of the King. The text of this grant was disseminated in the form of royal letters patent, which were sent to bishops, sheriffs and others throughout the land. Only four of these letters, the 'originals' of Magna Carta, survive. Two are in the British Library; the others are held by Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals. Magna Carta was promptly overturned by the Pope, to whom John had given the overlordship of England. Civil war was renewed, and John died while still fighting the rebels.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This London binding of c.1572 is believed to have been commissioned for presentation to Elizabeth I by its author, Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury. Although the Queen was given gold-tooled leather bindings as gifts, her personal preference seems to have been for velvet bindings. Paul Hentzner on a visit to the Royal Library in 1598, noted that the books were all “bound in velvet of different colours, though chiefly red, with clasps of gold and silver; some have pearls, and precious stones, set in their bindings”. Although the structure of this binding would have been made in a binder's workshop, the decoration would have been sewn by a professional embroiderer.Matthew Parker commissioned many bindings from the leading London workshops of the day including Jean de Planche, the Morocco Binder and the MacDurnan Gospels Binder. Specially bound copies of Parker's own and other works were bound for recipients including Cambridge University Library and possibly Lord Burghley. From 1572-75, Parker's bindings were produced in his private bindery, established in the Archbishop's London residence, Lambeth Palace. The book is bound in green velvet worked with gold and silver threads and coloured silks. The subject of the design, a deer park, may be a punning reference to Parker's name.</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This splendid manuscript, without a doubt a Florentine miniature masterpiece of the Renaissance, was commissioned by Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, at the atelier of Vespasiano da Bisticci, the renowned Florentine bookseller who was the primary provider of manuscripts for the Urbino library. The Bible is divided into two books. Hugo de Cominellis or Hugues de Comminellis de Mazieres, who was also responsible for other books commissioned by Federico da Montefeltro, has been identified as the scribe of these volumes. The copy is a transcription of the canonic text of the Vulgate.The volumes are particularly important for the richness of their illustrations. Scholars have identified the hands of a number of different artists who cooperated in decorating these volumes, among them, panel painters, fresco painters and miniature painters. The Urbino Bible is one of the rare examples of such artistic collaboration in Florence at the end of 15th century. The artists involved in these splendid decorations include Attavante, the Master of the Hamilton Xenophon, Francesco Rosselli, the brother of the most famous Cosimo, Francesco d'Antonio del Chierico, to whom we owe the greatest number of the illustrations, Biagio d'Antonio, Bartolomeo di Giovanni and David and Domenico Ghirlandaio.

		<dc:description>The manuscript, a Jewish juridic text, is divided into four main sections containing prescriptions for prayer, butchering and eating, family life and the administration of justice. The colophon tells us that the manuscript was written in Mantua in 1435. The style of the decorationessentially confirms this. The first page of each of the four books presents a precious miniature depicting the themes of the book itself, enriched by a floral border. The image displayed is f.220r, the first page of the third book, dedicated to marriage and to the laws governing family life. The miniature represents a nuptial scene.Copyright: Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This 1550 binding was made by Jörg Bernhard and is one of the many ostentatious bindings which the Elector Ottheinrich (1502-1559) liked so much. The volume was part of his broad legal collection. It was Ottheinrich who officially introduced the Reformation into Heidelberg in 1556. This volume like many of the Barberini volumes originally had been part of the Palatina library from Heidelberg which was given to Gregory XV (Alessandro Ludovisi, 1515-1623; Pope from 1621). Gregory died in July 1623 and by the time the books arrived in Rome in August of that year, a Barberini (Urban VIII, Maffeo Barberini, 1568-1644; Pope from 1623) was Pope; soon he gave many of the newly acquired volumes to his bibliophile nephew and cardinal, Francesco. Maffeo, as Pope, favored his nephew's collection over that of the Vatican for the deposit of books he received as presents, perhaps because the original core of that collection had been his own personal library. The volumes again became part of the Vatican collections in 1902 when Leo XIII (Gioacchino Pecci, 1810-1903; Pope from 1878) purchased the Barberini Library.Copyright: Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This celebrated manuscript of the Bible, contains the entire text of the Old and New Testament, and has been preserved in the Vatican Library since the 15th century. The manuscript is not complete; some sections were reconstructed in the 15th century (Gn 1,1-46,28; Sal 106,27-138,6 [= 105,27-137,6]; part of the Letter to the Hebrews and Revelations: the text is in fact interrupted at p. 1518 at Hebrews 9, 14). Originally the manuscript was without ornamentation. Simple head bands and initial letters were added later, probably during the 10th century, at the beginning of the individual books of the Bible.Copyright: Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana</dc:description>

		<dc:description>Scipione Forteguerri da Pistoia (1466-1515) was a member and the first Secretary of the Aldine Academy. He was the teacher of Pope Clement VII [Giulio de' Medici (1478-1534; Pope from 1523)]. The Aldine New Academy was an ambition never realized fully and about which we know little. After 1502 we find the phrase "ex neacademia nostra" in the colophon of many Aldine volumes. This unique piece of evidence was found as a pastedown inside the upper cover of a volume containing two other Venice non-Aldine imprints: ETYMOLOGICUM MAGNUM GRAECUM [Greek] (Ed: Marcus Musurus). Venice: Zacharias Callierges, for Nicolaus Blastus and Anna Notaras, 8 July 1499 and GALENUS, CLAUDIUS (Therapeutica) [Greek]. Venice: [Zacharias Callierges, for] Nicolaus Blastus, 5 Oct. 1500. It gives some insight into the organization of the academy.Copyright: Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana</dc:description>

		<dc:description>This celebrated image is one of the seven drawings that the Vatican Library possesses of Dante Alighieri's 'Divine Comedy' illustrated by Sandro Botticelli, one of the most sophisticated painters and draughtsmen of Renaissance Florence. Botticelli's drawings hold an outstanding place in the history of 'Divine Comedy' illustrations; the artist depicted the topography of the three realms Hell, Purgatory and Paradise, each in a distinctive way.Shown here in the Chart of Hell is a cross-section through the Underworld containing a multitude of figures. Viewers can trace Virgil's and Dante's passage down through the nine circles of Hell. The drawings, created between 1480-1495, were commissioned to the artist by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, a cousin of the more famous Lorenzo il Magnifico. They became part of the Vatican Library collections in the 17th century. A large number of them are now in the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin.Copyright: Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana</dc:description>
